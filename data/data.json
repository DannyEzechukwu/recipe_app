Melt the butter in a small pan, then add the biscuit crumbs and stir until coated with butter. Tip into the tart tin and, using the back of a spoon, press over the base and sides of the tin to give an even layer. Chill in the fridge while you make the filling. Cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy (Note: This can be done in a food processor if you have one). Process for 2-3 minutes. Mix in the egg, then add the ground almonds and almond extract and blend until well combined. Peel the apples, and cut thin slices of apple. Do this at the last minute to prevent the apple going brown. Arrange the slices over the biscuit base. Spread the frangipane filling evenly on top. Level the surface and sprinkle with the flaked almonds. Bake until golden-brown and set. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for 15 minutes. Remove the sides of the tin. An easy way to do this is to stand the tin on a can of beans and push down gently on the edges of the tin. Transfer the tart, with the tin base attached, to a serving plate. Serve warm with cream, crème fraîche or ice cream.",

Add the clove, cardamom, tamarind pulp, coconut milk, water, sugar and salt. Turn the heat up and bring the mixture to boil. Turn the heat to medium low and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir occasionally, it will reduce slightly. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Don't worry if it's slightly bitter, bitterness will go away when roasting. When the marinade sauce has cooled, pour everything over the chicken and marinate overnight. Preheat the oven to 425F (220C) . Remove the chicken from the marinade. Spoon the marinade onto a greased (or aluminum lined) baking sheet. Lay the chicken on top of the sauce (make sure the chicken covers the sauce and the sauce isn't exposed or it'll burn) and spread the remaining marinade on the chicken. Roast until internal temp of the thickest part of chicken is at least 175F (80C). Let chicken rest for 5 minutes. Brush the chicken with some of the oil. Serve chicken with the sauce over steamed rice.",

Season the beef and sear in the hot pan for 30 seconds only on each side (Note: You don't want to cook it at this stage, just colour it). Remove the beef from the pan and leave to cool, then brush all over with the mustard. Lay a sheet of cling film on a work surface and arrange the Parma ham slices on it, in slightly overlapping rows. With a palette knife, spread the mushroom paste over the ham, then place the seared beef fillet in the middle. Keeping a tight hold of the cling film from the edge, neatly roll the Parma ham and mushrooms around the beef to form a tight barrel shape. Twist the ends of the cling film to secure. Chill for 10 minutes to allow the beef to set and keep its shape. Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface to a large rectangle, the thickness of a coin. Remove the cling film from the beef, then lay in the centre. Brush the surrounding pastry with egg yolk. Fold the ends over, the wrap the pastry around the beef, cutting off any excess. Turn over, so the seam is underneath, and place on a baking sheet. Brush over all the pastry with egg and chill to let the pastry rest. Heat the oven to 400F (200C). Lightly score the pastry at \u00bd inch (1 cm) intervals and glaze again with beaten egg yolk. Bake for 20 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 350F (180C), and cook for another 15 minutes.

Roast the aubergine until its completely cooked and tender. With a knife check the doneness. The knife should slid easily in aubergines without any resistance. Remove the baingan and immerse in a bowl of water till it cools down. Heat a small piece of natural charcoal on a flame till it becomes smoking hot and red. Make small cuts on the baingan with a knife. Place the red hot charcoal in the same plate where the roasted aubergine is kept. Add a few drops of oil on the charcoal until it begins to smoke. As soon as smoke begins to release from the charcoal, cover the entire plate tightly with a large bowl. Allow the charcoal smoke to get infused for 2 minutes. Peel the skin from the roasted and smoked eggplant. Chop the cooked eggplant finely or you can even mash it. In a kadai or pan, heat oil. Then add finely onion and garlic. Saute the onion till translucent. Add chopped green chillies and saute for a minute. Add the tomato and mix it well. Saute the tomato till the oil starts separating from the mixture. Now add the chilli powder, stir and mix well. Add the chopped cooked baingan. Stir and mix the chopped baingan very well with the onion and tomato masala mixture. Season with salt. Continue to stir and saute. Finally stir in the coriander leaves with the baingan bharta or garnish it with them. Serve Baingan Bharta with phulkas, rotis or chapatis.",

Using a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch (2 cm) apart. Slice through the fat, not the beef. Repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern. Salt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature until satisfied. Pat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat. Cook for 5-8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned. Turn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side. Saute the onion and garlic. When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside. There should be a couple tbsp of fat rendered in the pot, if not, add some olive oil. Add the onion and increase the heat to high. Sprinkle a little salt on the onion. Saute, stirring often, until the onion are lightly browned, 5-8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook a minute longer. Preaheat oven to 300F (150C). Return brisket to pot, add herbs, stock, bring to simmer, cover, cook in oven. Use kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme. Move the onion and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside. Add the beef stock and the tied-up herbs. Bring the stock to a boil on the stovetop. Cover the pot, place the pot in the oven and cook for 3 hours. Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly. After 3 hours, add the carrots. Cover the pot and cook until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender. When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board. Cover it with foil. Pull out and discard the herbs. To make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onion, set aside and cover them with foil. Pour the ingredients that are remaining into the pot into a blender, and purée until smooth.

In the same pan, add another tbsp of oil and cook the shallots for 4-5 minutes, then add the garlic and fry for 30 seconds. Add the bacon and fry until slightly browned. Transfer the onion and bacon mixture to the casserole dish and add the herbs. Preheat the oven to 350F (180C). Pour the stout into the frying pan and bring to the boil, stirring to lift any stuck-on browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Pour the stout over the beef in the casserole dish and add the stock. Cover the casserole and place it in the oven for until the beef is tender and the sauce is reduced. Skim off any surface fat, taste and add salt and pepper if necessary, then stir in the cornflour paste. Put the casserole dish on the hob and simmer for 1-2 minutes, stirring, until thickened. Leave to cool. Increase the oven to 400F (200C). To make the pastry, put the flour and salt in a very large bowl. Grate the butter and stir it into the flour in three batches. Gradually add 325ml of cold water, and stir until the mixture just comes together. Knead the pastry lightly into a ball on a lightly floured surface and set aside 250g for the pie lid. Roll the rest of the pastry out until it is about 3/4 of an inch (2cm)larger than the dish you're using. Line the dish with the pastry then pile in the filling, tucking the oysters in as well. Brush the edge of the pastry with beaten egg. Roll the remaining pastry until slightly larger than your dish and gently lift over the filling, pressing the edges firmly to seal, then trim with a sharp knife. Brush with beaten egg to glaze. Put the dish on a baking tray and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling is bubbling.",

        "strInstructions": "For the biscuits, preheat the oven to 400F (200C) and line two large baking trays with baking parchment. Scatter the nuts over a baking tray and roast in the oven until golden-brown. Watch them carefully so that they don't have a chance to burn. Remove from the oven, tip onto a board and leave to cool. Put the butter and sugar in a large bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until light and creamy. Roughly chop the cooled nuts and add to the creamed butter and sugar, along with the lemon zest, flour and baking powder. Stir well until the mixture comes together and forms a ball. Divide the biscuit dough into even pieces and roll into small balls. Place the balls on the prepared baking trays, spaced well apart to allow for spreading. Press the biscuits to flatten to around \u00bd inches (1 cm) thick. Bake the biscuits, one tray at a time until very pale golden-brown. Leave to cool on the trays. They will be very soft when you take them out of the oven, but will crisp as they cool. Store in an airtight tin and eat within five days. For the fool, rinse the blackberries in a colander to wash away any dust or dirt. Put the blackberries in a non-stick saucepan and sprinkle over the caster sugar. Stir in the lemon juice and heat gently for 2 minutes, or until the blackberries begin to soften and release their juices. Remove and reserve 12 blackberries for decoration and continue cooking the rest. Simmer the blackberries very gently for 15 minutes, stirring regularly until very soft and squidgy. Remove from the heat and press the berries and juice through a sieve over a bowl, using the bottom of a ladle to help you extract as much of the purée as possible. Leave the purée to cool and discard the seeds. You should end up with around 325ml of purée. Put the cream and yoghurt in a large bowl and whip with an electric whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl. When the purée is completely cold, adjust the sweetness to taste by adding more sugar if needed. Pour it into the bowl with the whipped cream and yoghurt and stir just once or twice until very lightly combined. Spoon the blackberry fool into individual wide, glass dishes or one large, single bowl. It should look quite marbled. Scatter a few tiny mint leaves on top and decorate with the reserved blackberries. Sprinkle with a little sugar if you like and serve with the hazelnut biscuits.",

        "strInstructions": "Heat oven to 355F (180C) and line the base and sides of a tin with baking parchment. To make the almond sponge, put the butter, sugar, flour, ground almonds, baking powder, egg, vanilla and almond extract in a large bowl. Beat with an electric whisk until the mix comes together smoothly. Scrape into the tin, spreading to the corners, and bake for 25-30 minutes (Note: When you poke in a skewer, it should come out clean). Cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling while you make the second sponge. For the pink sponge, line the tin like previously before. Mix all the ingredients together like previouly done before, but don't add the almond extract. Fold in some pink food colouring. Scrape it all into the tin and bake as before. Cool. To assemble, heat the jam in a small pan until runny, then sieve. Barely trim two opposite edges from the almond sponge, then well trim a third edge. Roughly measure the height of the sponge, then cutting from the well-trimmed edge, use a ruler to help you cut 4 slices each the same width as the sponge height. Discard or nibble leftover sponge. Repeat with pink cake. Take 2 x almond slices and 2 x pink slices and trim so they are all the same length. Roll out one marzipan block on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar to just over 8 inchec (20 cm) wide, then keep rolling lengthways until the marzipan is roughly .25 inches (\u00bd cm) thick. Brush with apricot jam, then lay a pink and an almond slice side by side at one end of the marzipan, brushing jam in between to stick sponges, and leaving 1\u00bd inches (4 cm) clear marzipan at the end. Brush more jam on top of the sponges, then sandwich remaining 2 slices on top, alternating colours to give a checkerboard effect. Trim the marzipan to the length of the cakes. Carefully lift up the marzipan and smooth over the cake with your hands, but leave a small marzipan fold along the bottom edge before you stick it to the first side. Trim opposite side to match size of fold, then crimp edges using fingers and thumb. Assemble second Battenberg and keep in an airtight box or well wrapped in cling film for up to 3 days. Can be frozen for up to a month.",

        "strArea": "French",
        "strInstructions": "Heat a large casserole pan and add 1 tbsp goose fat. Season the beef and fry until golden brown, about 3-5 minutes, then turn over and fry the other side until the meat is browned all over, adding more fat if necessary. Do this in 2-3 batches, transferring the meat to a colander set over a bowl when browned. In the same pan, fry the bacon, shallots or pearl onion, mushrooms, garlic and bouquet garni until lightly browned. Mix in the tomato purée and cook for a few minutes, stirring into the mixture. This enriches the bourguignon and makes a great base for the stew. Then return the beef and any drained juices to the pan and stir through. Pour over the wine and about 100ml water so the meat bobs up from the liquid, but isn't completely covered. Bring to the boil and use a spoon to scrape the caramelised cooking juices from the bottom of the pan. Heat oven to 300F (150C). Tear off a square of foil slightly larger than the casserole, arrange it in the pan so it covers the top of the stew and trim away any excess foil. Cook for 3 hrs (Note: If the sauce looks watery, remove the beef and veg with a slotted spoon, and set aside). Cook the sauce over a high heat for a few minutes until the sauce has thickened a little, then return the beef and vegetables to the pan. To make the celeriac mash, peel the celeriac and cut into cubes. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan. Tip in the celeriac and fry for until it turns golden. Season well with salt and pepper. Stir in the rosemary, thyme, bay and cardamom pods, then pour over 200ml water or enough to nearly cover the celeriac. Turn the heat to low, partially cover the pan and leave to simmer for 25-30 minutes, or until most of the water has evaporated. Drain away any remaining water, then remove the herb sprigs, bay and cardamom pods. Lightly crush with a potato masher, then finish with a glug of olive oil and season to taste. Spoon the beef bourguignon into serving bowls and place a large spoonful of the celeriac mash on top. Garnish with one of the bay leaves, if you like.",

Wash the potato and cut medium dice into square pieces. To prevent any browning, place the already cut potato in a bowl filled with water. In the meantime, heat 1-2 tbsp of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Tilt the skillet so the oil spreads evenly. Once the oil is hot, drain the potato and add to the skillet. Season with salt, pepper, and Old Bay as needed. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring the potato often, until brown. If needed, add a tbsp more of oil. Chop up the bacon and add to the potato. The bacon will start to render and the fat will begin to further cook the potato. The bacon will take 5-6 minutes to crisp. Once the bacon is cooked, reduce the heat to medium-low, add the minced garlic and toss. Season once more. Add dried or fresh parsley. Control heat as needed. Let the garlic cook until fragrant. Just before serving, drizzle over the maple syrup and toss. Let that cook another minute, giving the potato a caramelized effect. Serve in a warm bowl with a sunny side up egg.",

Cut the other 2 into large chunks, then boil until tender. Meanwhile, squeeze as much of the liquid from the grated potato as you can using a clean tea towel. Mash the boiled potato, then mix with the grated potato, spring onion and flour. Whisk the egg white in a large bowl until it holds soft peaks. Fold in the buttermilk, then add the bicarbonate of soda. Fold into the potato mix. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, then add 1 tbsp butter and some of the oil. Drop 3-4 spoonfuls of the potato mixture into the pan, then gently cook on each side until golden and crusty. Keep warm on a plate in the oven while you cook the next batch, adding more butter and oil to the pan before you do so. You will get 16 crumpet-size boxty from the mix. Can be made the day ahead, drained on kitchen paper, then reheated in a low oven for 20 minutes. Heat the grill to medium and put the tomato in a heavy-based pan. Add a good knob of butter and a little oil, then fry for about until softened. Grill the bacon, then pile onto a plate and keep warm. Stack up the boxty, bacon and egg, and serve the tomato on the side.",

Pour Enchilada sauce over it and cook covered on low to medium heat until chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes. No water is needed, the chicken will cook in the Enchilada sauce. Make sure you stir occasionally so that it doesn't stick to the bottom. Remove chicken from the pot and shred with two forks. Preheat oven to 375F (190C). Start layering the casserole.

Next, add the spices turmeric and chilli powder. Saute the spices well for couple of minutes. Add the chicken pieces to the wok, season it with salt to taste and cook the chicken covered on medium-low heat until the chicken is almost cooked through. Slowly sauteing the chicken will enhance the flavor, so do not expedite this step by putting it on high heat. When the oil separates from the spices, add the beaten yogurt keeping the heat on lowest so that the yogurt doesn't split.

Add the shallots to the pan and fry, stirring or shaking the pan often until well browned all over. Remove and set aside with the bacon. Pat the chicken pieces dry with kitchen paper. Pour the remaining oil into the pan, then fry half the chicken pieces, turning regularly until well browned. Remove, then repeat with the remaining chicken. Remove and set aside. Scatter in the garlic and fry briefly, then, with the heat medium-high, pour in the brandy or Cognac, stirring the bottom of the pan to deglaze. The alcohol should sizzle and start to evaporate so there is not much left. Return the chicken legs and thighs to the pan along with any juices, then pour in a little of the wine, stirring the bottom of the pan again. Stir in the rest of the wine, the stock and tomato purée, drop in the bouquet garni, season with pepper and a pinch of salt, then return the bacon and shallots to the pan. Cover, lower the heat to a gentle simmer, add the chicken breast and cook for 1 hour. Just before ready to serve, heat the oil for the mushrooms in a large non-stick frying pan. Add the mushrooms and fry over a high heat for a few minutes until golden. Remove and keep warm. Lift the chicken, shallots and bacon from the pan and transfer to a warmed serving dish. Remove the bouquet garni. To make the thickener, mix the flour, olive oil and butter in a small bowl using the back of a tsp. Bring the wine mixture to a gentle boil, then gradually drop in small pieces of the thickener, whisking each piece in using a wire whisk. Simmer for 1-2 minutes. Scatter the mushrooms over the chicken, then pour over the wine sauce. Garnish with parsley.",

Stir in the onion, thyme and bay and cook everything gently for until the onion is soft and golden. Scatter over the flour and stir in to make a sandy paste, cook for 2 minutes more, then gradually stir in the clam stock then the milk and the cream. Throw in the potato, bring everything to a simmer and leave to bubble away gently for until the potato are cooked. Use a fork to crush a few of the potato chunks against the side of the pan to help thicken. Try to maintain some defined chunks though. Stir through the clam meat and the few clam shells, if you've gone down that route, and simmer for a minute to reheat.

Once all the liquid has been added, season with pepper, a pinch of nutmeg and mustard powder. Put the saucepan back onto a medium heat and slowly bring it to the boil, stirring all the time. Once the sauce has thickened, place on a very low heat. Add the cooked chicken and vegetables to the sauce and stir well. Grease a medium-size ovenproof pie dish with a little butter and pour in the chicken and mushroom filling.

Drizzle 2-3 tsp cold water into the funnel while the blade is running, the mixture should start to clump together. Tip onto a work surface and bring together, kneading briefly into a ball. Pat into a disc, wrap in cling film, and chill for at least 20 minutes. Heat oven to 400F (200C). Remove the pastry from the fridge and leave at room temperature unitl it softens. Flour the work surface, then unwrap the pastry and roll to a circle the thickness of a coin. Use the pastry to line a deep round fluted tin. Press the pastry into the corners and up the sides, making sure there are no gaps. Leave \u00bd an inch (1 cm) pastry overhanging. Line with baking parchment (scrunch it up first to make it more pliable) and fill with baking beans. Bake until the sides are set, then remove the parchment and beans and return to oven until golden brown. Trim the pastry so its flush with the top of the tin, a small serrated knife is best for this. If there are any cracks, patch them up with the pastry scraps. Meanwhile, weigh the butter, syrup and sugars into a pan, and add 1/4 tsp salt. Heat until the butter has melted and the sugar dissolved, stirring until smooth. Remove from the heat and cool for 10 minutes. Reduce oven to 320F (160C). Beat the egg in a bowl. Add the syrup mixture, vanilla and pecans, and mix until well combined. Pour half the mixture into the tart case, scatter over half the chocolate chips, then cover with the remaining filling and chocolate chips. Bake on the middle shelf until set. Remove from the oven and leave to cool, then chill for at least 2 hours before serving.",

        "strInstructions": "Heat the chicken stock in a lidded saucepan. Add the chicken breast and bring to a low simmer. Cover with a lid and cook for 10 minutes. Remove the chicken breast from the water with tongs and place on a plate. Pour the cooking liquor into a large jug. Melt 25g of the butter in a large heavy-based saucepan over a low heat. Stir in the leeks and fry gently for two minutes, stirring occasionally until just softened. Add the garlic and cook for a further minute. Add the remaining butter and stir in the flour as soon as the butter has melted. Cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Slowly pour the milk into the pan, just a little at a time, stirring well between each adding. Gradually add 250ml of the reserved stock and the wine, if using, stirring until the sauce is smooth and thickened slightly. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 3 minutes. Season the mixture, to taste, with salt and freshly ground pepper. Remove from the heat and stir in the cream. Pour into a large bowl and cover the surface of the sauce with cling film to prevent a skin forming. Set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 400F (200C). Put a baking tray in the oven to heat. For the pastry, put the flour and butter in a food processor and blend on the pulse setting until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. With the motor running, add the beaten egg and water and blend until the mixture forms a ball. Portion off 250g of pastry for the lid. Roll the remaining pastry out on a lightly floured surface, turning the pastry frequently until around 1/4 of an inch (.635 cm) thick and 1\u00bd inch (4 cm) larger than the pie dish. Lift the pastry over the rolling pin and place it gently into the pie dish. Press the pastry firmly up the sides, making sure there are no air bubbles. Leave the excess pastry overhanging the sides. Cut the chicken breast into 1\u00bd inch (4 cm) pieces. Stir the chicken, ham and leeks into the cooled sauce. Pour the chicken filling into the pie dish. Brush the rim of the dish with beaten egg. Roll out the reserved pastry for the lid. Cover the pie with the pastry lid and press the edges together firmly to seal. Trim any excess pastry. Make a small hole in the center of the pie with the tip of a knife. Glaze the top of the pie with beaten egg. Bake on the preheated tray in the center of the oven until the pie is golden-brown all over and the filling is hot.",

Lightly oil a bowl with a little of the vegetable oil. Place the dough into the bowl and turn until it is covered in the oil. Cover the bowl with cling film and set aside in a warm place for 1 hour, or until the dough has doubled in size. Lightly grease a baking tray. For the filling, knock the dough back to its original size and turn out onto a lightly floured work surface. Roll the dough out into a rectangle 1/4 of an inch (0\u00bdcm) thick. Brush all over with the melted butter, then sprinkle over the brown sugar, cinnamon and dried fruit. Roll the dough up into a tight cylinder , cut ten 1\u00bd inch (4cm) slices and place them onto a lightly greased baking sheet, leaving a little space between each slice.

Cut out circles of pastry, using a plate as a guide, and place on a non-stick baking sheet. Sprinkle each circle with 1 tbsp sugar and grill for 5 minutes to caramelise, watching carefully so that the sugar doesn't burn. Remove from the grill. Can be done a few hours ahead, and left, covered, out of the fridge. Peel, quarter and core the apples, cut into 2mm-thin slices and arrange on top of the pastry. Sprinkle over the remaining sugar and pop in the oven until the pastry is cooked through and golden, and the apples are softened. Remove and allow to cool slightly. Warm 3 tbsp of the red wine jelly in a small pan over a low heat with 1 tsp water to make it a little more runny, then brush over the top of the tarts.

Then cut out 18-20 rounds with a 3 inch (7\u00bd cm) fluted cutter, re-rolling the trimmings. Use the rounds to line two deep 12-hole tart tins. If you only have a regular-sized, 12-hole tart tin you will be able to make a few more slightly shallower tarts. Beat the egg in a large bowl and combine with the rest of the ingredients except the walnuts. Tip this mixture into a pan and stir continuously until the butter melts, and the mixture bubbles and starts to thicken. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Don't overcook, and be sure to stir all the time as the mixture can easily burn. Remove from the heat and stir in the nuts. Spoon the filling into the unbaked tart shells so it's level with the pastry. Bake until set and pale golden. Leave in the tin to cool for a few minutes before lifting out on to a wire rack. Serve warm or cold.",

Add the rest of the oil, then the peppers and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the chorizo, sun-dried tomatoes and garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the rice, stirring to ensure it is well coated in the oil. Stir in the tomato paste, paprika, bay leaves and chopped thyme. Pour in the stock and wine. When the liquid starts to bubble, turn the heat down to a gentle simmer. Press the rice down into the liquid if it isn't already submerged and place the chicken on top. Add the lemon wedges and olives around the chicken. Cover and cook in the oven for 50 minutes. The rice should be cooked but still have some bite, and the chicken should have juices that run clear when pierced in the thickest part with a knife. Serve.",

Finally add vegetable, salt, mix well, and steamed for about until leaves are tender. Add a tiny bit of water as needed. Adjust seasonings and turn off the heat. Using a sharp knife cut both ends off the plantain. This will make it easy to grab the skin of the plantains. Slit a shallow line down the long seam of the plantain; peel only as deep as the peel. Remove plantain peel by pulling it back. Slice the plantain into medium size lengthwise slices and set aside. Coat a large frying pan with cooking oil spray. Spray the tops of the plantains with a generous layer of oil spray and sprinkle with salt and freshly ground pepper. Let the plantains fry on medium heat, shaking the frying pan to redistribute them every few minutes. As the plantains brown, continue to add more cooking oil spray, salt and pepper until they have reached the desired color and texture. Remove and serve with kale",

        "strInstructions": "This dish shoild be made as close to Christmas day as possible. Get everything for the pudding prepared. Chop the almonds coarsely. Peel, core and chop the cooking apples. Sharpen your knife and chop the candied peel. You can chop the almonds and apples in a food processor, but the peel must be done by hand. Grate three quarters of the nutmeg. Mix the almonds, apples, candied peel, nutmeg, raisins, flour, breadcrumbs, light muscovado sugar, egg and 2 tbsp brandy or cognac in a large bowl. Holding the butter in its wrapper, grate a quarter of it into the bowl, then stir everything together. Repeat until all the butter is grated, then stir for 3-4 minutes. The mixture is ready when it subsides slightly after each stir. Generously butter two decent sized bowls and put a circle of baking parchment in the bottom of each. Pack in the pudding mixture. Cover with a double layer of baking parchment, pleating it to allow for expansion, then tie with string (Note: keep the paper in place with a rubber band while tying). Trim off any excess paper. Now stand each bowl on a large sheet of foil and bring the edges up over the top, then put another sheet of foil over the top and bring it down underneath to make a double package (Note: this makes the puddings watertight). Tie with more string, and make a handle for easy lifting in and out of the pan. Boil or oven steam the puddings for 8 hours, topping up with water as necessary. Remove from the pans and leave to cool overnight. When cold, discard the messy wrappings and re-wrap in new baking parchment, foil and string. Store in a cool, dry place until Christmas. To make the brandy butter, cream the butter with the orange zest and icing sugar. Gradually beat in the brandy or cognac and chopped stem ginger. Put in a small bowl, fork the top attractively and put in the fridge to set. The butter will keep for a week in the fridge, or it can be frozen for up to six weeks. On Christmas Day, boil or oven steam for 1 hour. Unwrap and turn out. To flame, warm 3-4 tbsp brandy in a small pan, pour it over the pudding and set light to it.",

Preheat the oven to 180C/160 C fan/Gas Mark 4. Line a deep loose-based 20cm cake tin with baking parchment. Put the butter in a large bowl and beat well until soft. Add the sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Stir in the orange zest and apricot jam. Sieve together the flour and baking powder. Add the egg to the creamed butter and sugar, a little at a time, beating well between each addition. If the mixture starts to curdle, stir in a little flour. Add the remaining flour and ground almonds and mix well. Mix in the milk and then add the dried fruit and cherries and mix gently together. Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and spread level using the back of a spoon. Arrange the whole almonds close together in neat circles on the top of the cake. Bake in the oven for 45 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 160C/140 C fan/Gas Mark 3 and cook for a further 60\u201380 minutes. Check the cake after 50 minutes by inserting a wooden or metal skewer into the cake. When it\u2019s done it should have just a few crumbs attached. Check every 10 minutes - it\u2019s important not to overcook this cake so the centre will be a little soft. When cooked, remove the cake briefly from the oven, put the milk and sugar into a small pan and heat gently until the sugar has dissolved. Brush over the top of the cake and return the cake to the oven for 2-3 minutes. Remove and allow the cake to cool in the tin. When quite cold remove from the tin and wrap in foil and keep for at least 2 days before cutting.",

        "strInstructions": "The day before you want to make the dish, scatter half the salt, half the garlic and half of the herbs over the base of a small shallow dish. Lay the duck legs, skin-side up, on top, then scatter over the remaining salt, garlic and herbs. Cover the duck and refrigerate overnight. This can be done up to 2 days ahead. Pour the wine into a saucepan that will snugly fit the duck legs in a single layer. Brush the salt off the duck legs and place them, skin-side down, in the wine. Cover the pan with a lid and place over a medium heat. As soon as the wine starts to bubble, turn the heat down to the lowest setting and cook for 2 hours, checking occasionally that the liquid is just barely simmering. (If you own a heat diffuser, it would be good to use it here.) After 2 hours, the duck legs should be submerged in their own fat and the meat should feel incredibly tender when prodded. Leave to cool. The duck legs are now cooked and can be eaten immediately \u2013 or you can follow the next step if you like them crisp. If you are preparing ahead, pack the duck legs tightly into a plastic container or jar and pour over the fat, but not the liquid at the bottom of the pan. Cover and leave in the fridge for up to a month, or freeze for up to 3 months. The liquid you are left with makes a tasty gravy, which can be chilled or frozen until needed. To reheat and crisp up the duck legs, heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Remove the legs from the fat and place them, skin-side down, in an ovenproof frying pan. Roast for 30-40 minutes, turning halfway through, until brown and crisp. Serve with the reheated gravy, a crisp salad and some crisp golden ptoatoes.",

Tip flour into the bowl of a food processor with half the butter and pulse to the texture of breadcrumbs. Pour in the lemon juice and 100ml iced water, and pulse to a dough. Tip in the rest of the butter and pulse a few times until the dough is heavily flecked with butter. It is important that you don\u2019t overdo this as the flecks of butter are what makes the pastry flaky. On a floured surface roll the pastry out to a neat rectangle about 20 x 30cm. Fold the two ends of the pastry into the middle (See picture 1), then fold in half (pic 2). Roll the pastry out again and refold the same way 3 more times resting the pastry for at least 15 minutes each time between roll and fold, then leave to rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before using. To make the filling, melt the butter in a large saucepan. Take it off the heat and stir in all the other ingredients until completely mixed, then set aside. To make the cakes, roll the pastry out until it\u2019s just a little thicker than a \u00a31 coin and cut out 8 rounds about 12cm across. Re-roll the trimming if needed. Place a good heaped tbsp of mixture in the middle of each round, brush the edges of the rounds with water, then gather the pastry around the filling and squeeze it together (pic 3). Flip them over so the smooth top is upwards and pat them into a smooth round. Flatten each round with a rolling pin to an oval until the fruit just starts to poke through, then place on a baking tray. Cut 2 little slits in each Eccles cakes, brush generously with egg white and sprinkle with the sugar (pic 4). Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 8. Bake the Eccles cakes for 15-20 minutes until just past golden brown and sticky. Leave to cool on a rack and enjoy while still warm or cold with a cup of tea. If you prefer, Eccles cakes also go really well served with a wedge of hard, tangy British cheese such as Lancashire or cheddar.",

        "strInstructions": "Heat the flat grill plate over a low heat, on top of 2 rings/flames if it fits, and brush sparingly with light olive oil. Cook the sausages first. Add the sausages to the hot grill plate/the coolest part if there is one and allow to cook slowly for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden. After the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium before beginning to cook the other ingredients. If you are struggling for space, completely cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the oven. Snip a few small cuts into the fatty edge of the bacon. Place the bacon straight on to the grill plate and fry for 2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness is reached. Like the sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate in the oven. For the mushrooms, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush and trim the stalk level with the mushroom top. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle over a little olive oil. Place stalk-side up on the grill plate and cook for 1-2 minutes before turning and cooking for a further 3-4 minutes. Avoid moving the mushrooms too much while cooking, as this releases the natural juices, making them soggy. For the tomato, cut the tomato across the centre/or in half lengthways if using plum tomatoes , and with a small, sharp knife remove the green 'eye'. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil. Place cut-side down on the grill plate and cook without moving for 2 minutes. Gently turn over and season again. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender but still holding their shape. For the black pudding, cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin. Place on the grill plate and cook for 1\u00bd-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy. For 'proper' fried bread it's best to cook it in a separate pan. Ideally, use bread that is a couple of days old. Heat a frying pan to a medium heat and cover the base with oil. Add the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side until crispy and golden. If the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil. For a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice. For the fried egg, break the egg straight into the pan with the fried bread and leave for 30 seconds. Add a good knob of butter and lightly splash/baste the egg with the butter when melted. Cook to your preferred stage, season and gently remove with a fish slice. Once all the ingredients are cooked, serve on warm plates and enjoy straight away with a good squeeze of tomato ketchup or brown sauce.",

        "strInstructions": "To prepare bread for bottom of dish: Take pita bread and rip into bite size pieces. In a frying pan, add about a 1/4 stick of butter, add bread pieces and fry until golden brown and crisp. Put these pieces in a glass baking dish, preferably a square sized dish. Set aside. Then add to same pan, a little more butter, salt, approximately 2 clove of crushed fresh garlic, and a tsp or so of cumin stir around a bit until you can smell aroma, then add fried bread pieces to this mixture, stir to coat bread and put back into glass baking dish. Set aside. To prepare meat: put some butter in a pot, stir fry meat until brown, add 1 onion quartered, salt & pepper, 1 cube of chicken bouillon and water to cover meat. Bring to a boil, turn down to simmer, cover and cook until tender, approximately 2 hours. After meat has cooled, take out chunks of meat and put in a bowl, set aside. Reserve soup from the meat separately. To prepare the rice: Put some butter into a pot, add shareya (fideo noodles) like a handful or so, keep stirring until golden brown, not too dark, but very golden. Then add two cups of rice, stir a little bit until some of the rice turns an opaque white. Add 2-1/4 cups of water and salt to taste. Bring to a boil, cover and turn down to simmer, cook until tender. Test the rice tenderness after about 35 minutes. Now take some of the soup from meat and add to the top of the bread pieces in baking dish to saturate. Add cooked rice on top of bread pieces. Slowly spoon remainder of soup onto rice, looking at glass dish sides to see level of soup, should reach just to top of rice, don\u2019t worry, this doesn\u2019t have to be exact. Now you\u2019re ready to make the sauce and fry the meat to put on top. To prepare red sauce: In a pan, add a little oil or butter, crushed tomato, a half tsp of tomato paste, salt & pepper, 2 clove of fresh crushed garlic and cumin. Add also approximately 3 tbsp of vinegar, stir this until you smell aroma and it is a bit smooth. It should be a bit thick, not watery, but if too thick you can add a bit of water. Spread with a wooden spoon atop the rice to cover. To fry meat: In a pan add a bit of butter or oil, the meat, just a touch of tomato paste, about a tbsp of fresh crushed garlic, salt & pepper, a tsp of cumin. Cook until meat is golden fried. Spoon this atop the rice and serve. Enjoy!",

Add tbsp sugar, tsp diamond crystal or Morton kosher salt, and tsp of freshly ground pepper. Toss to evenly coat eggplant and let sit at room temperature at least 20 minutes. Peel and thinly slice 8 garlic. Add 3 tbsp vegetable oil and half of garlic to a medium Dutch oven or other heavy pot. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until light golden and crisp. Using a slotted spoon, transfer garlic chips to a plate and season lightly with salt. Place 4 oz of ground pork in same pot and break up into small pieces with wooden spoon. Season with tsp Diamond Crystal or Morton kosher salt and cook, undisturbed, until deeply browned underneath. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to another plate, leaving fat behind in the pot. Place eggplant on a clean kitchen towel and blot away any moisture the salt has drawn out. Working in batches and adding more oil if needed, cook eggplant in the same pot until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate with pork. Pour 1 cup of water into the pot and scrape up browned bits from the bottom with a wooden spoon. Add remaining garlic, 3 tbsp coconut vinegar or unseasoned rice vinegar, 2 tbsp soy sauce, 2 bay leaves, tsp freshly ground pepper, and remaining sugar. Bring to a simmer, then return pork and eggplant to pot. Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and simmer until eggplant is tender and silky and sauce is reduced by half. Taste and season with more salt and pepper and add a little more sugar if needed. Top with garlic chips and serve with cooked white rice.",

        "strInstructions": "Heat the flat grill plate over a low heat, on top of 2 rings/flames if it fits, and brush sparingly with light olive oil. Cook the sausages first. Add the sausages to the hot grill plate/the coolest part if there is one and allow to cook slowly for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden. After the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium before beginning to cook the other ingredients. If you are struggling for space, completely cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the oven. Snip a few small cuts into the fatty edge of the bacon. Place the bacon straight on to the grill plate and fry for 2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness is reached. Like the sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate in the oven. For the mushrooms, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush and trim the stalk level with the mushroom top. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle over a little olive oil. Place stalk-side up on the grill plate and cook for 1-2 minutes before turning and cooking for a further 3-4 minutes. Avoid moving the mushrooms too much while cooking, as this releases the natural juices, making them soggy. For the tomato, cut the tomato across the centre/or in half lengthways if using plum tomatoes , and with a small, sharp knife remove the green 'eye'. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil. Place cut-side down on the grill plate and cook without moving for 2 minutes. Gently turn over and season again. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender but still holding their shape. For the black pudding, cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin. Place on the grill plate and cook for 1\u00bd-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy. For 'proper' fried bread it's best to cook it in a separate pan. Ideally, use bread that is a couple of days old. Heat a frying pan to a medium heat and cover the base with oil. Add the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side until crispy and golden. If the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil. For a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice. For the fried egg, break the egg straight into the pan with the fried bread and leave for 30 seconds. Add a good knob of butter and lightly splash/baste the egg with the butter when melted. Cook to your preferred stage, season and gently remove with a fish slice. Once all the ingredients are cooked, serve on warm plates and enjoy straight away with a good squeeze of tomato ketchup or brown sauce.",

Crack the egg into a bowl and beat them with a fork so they break up and mix, but not as completely as you would for scrambled egg. With the heat on medium-hot, drop one knob of butter into the pan. It should bubble and sizzle, but not brown. Season the egg with the Parmesan and a little salt and pepper, and pour into the pan. Let the egg bubble slightly for a couple of seconds, then take a wooden fork or spatula and gently draw the mixture in from the sides of the pan a few times, so it gathers in folds in the centre. Leave for a few seconds, then stir again to lightly combine uncooked egg with cooked. Leave briefly again, and when partly cooked, stir a bit faster, stopping while there\u2019s some barely cooked egg left. With the pan flat on the heat, shake it back and forth a few times to settle the mixture. It should slide easily in the pan and look soft and moist on top. A quick burst of heat will brown the underside. Grip the handle underneath. Tilt the pan down away from you and let the omelette fall to the edge. Fold the side nearest to you over by a third with your fork, and keep it rolling over, so the omelette tips onto a plate \u2013 or fold it in half, if that\u2019s easier. For a neat finish, cover the omelette with a piece of kitchen paper and plump it up a bit with your fingers. Rub the other knob of butter over to glaze. Serve immediately.",

Fry the shells in 1 tbsp oil for 5 minutes, until dark pink and golden in patches. Add the wine, boil down by two thirds, then pour in the stock. Strain into a jug, discarding the shells. Heat the rest of the oil in a deep frying pan or casserole. Add the fennel, onion and garlic, season, then cover and gently cook for 10 minutes until softened. Meanwhile, peel the potato and cut into 2cm-ish chunks. Put into a pan of cold water, bring to the boil and cook for 5 minutes until almost tender. Drain in a colander. Peel a strip of zest from the orange. Put the zest, star anise, bay and \u00bd tsp harissa into the pan. Fry gently, uncovered, for 5-10 minutes, until the vegetables are soft, sweet and golden. Stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e, cook for 2 minutes, then add the tomato and stock. Simmer for 10 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly. Season to taste. The sauce can be made ahead, then reheated later in the day. Meantime, scrub the mussels or clams and pull away any stringy beards. Any that are open should be tapped sharply on the worktop \u2013 if they don\u2019t close after a few seconds, discard them. Reheat the sauce if necessary, then stir the potato, chunks of fish and prawns very gently into the stew. Bring back to the boil, then cover and gently simmer for 3 minutes. Scatter the mussels or clams over the stew, then cover and cook for 2 minutes more or until the shells have opened wide. Discard any that remain closed. The chunks of fish should flake easily and the prawns should be pink through. Scatter with the thyme leaves. To make the quick rouille, stir the rest of the harissa through the mayonnaise. Serve the stew in bowls, topped with spoonfuls of rouille, which will melt into the sauce and enrich it. Have some good bread ready, as you\u2019ll definitely want to mop up the juices.",

        "strInstructions": "As the cooking time varies depending on the quality and age of the beans, it is good to cook them in advance and to reheat them when you are ready to serve. Cook the drained beans in a fresh portion of unsalted water in a large saucepan with the lid on until tender, adding water to keep them covered, and salt when the beans have softened. They take 2\u20132 \u00bd hours of gentle simmering. When the beans are soft, let the liquid reduce. It is usual to take out a ladle or two of the beans and to mash them with some of the cooking liquid, then stir this back into the beans. This is to thicken the sauce. Serve the beans in soup bowls sprinkled with parsley and accompanied by Arab bread. Pass round the dressing ingredients for everyone to help themselves: a bottle of extra-virgin olive oil, the quartered lemon, salt and pepper, a little saucer with the crushed garlic, one with chilli-pepper flakes, and one with ground cumin. The beans are eaten gently crushed with the fork, so that they absorb the dressing. Optional Garnishes Peel hard-boiled egg\u20141 per person\u2014to cut up in the bowl with the beans. Top the beans with a chopped cucumber-and-tomato salad and thinly sliced mild onion or scallions. Otherwise, pass round a good bunch of scallions and quartered tomato and cucumbers cut into sticks. Serve with tahina cream sauce (page 65) or salad (page 67), with pickles and sliced onion soaked in vinegar for 30 minutes. Another way of serving ful medames is smothered in a garlicky tomato sauce (see page 464). In Syria and Lebanon, they eat ful medames with yogurt or feta cheese, olives, and small cucumbers. Variations A traditional way of thickening the sauce is to throw a handful of red lentils (1/4 cup) into the water at the start of the cooking. In Iraq, large brown beans are used instead of the small Egyptian ones, in a dish called badkila, which is also sold for breakfast in the street.",

If you feel the dough is still not coming together or too dry, gradually add the remaining water until you get a dough that is very elastic so that when you pull it and it won't be torn. Let the dough rest for just 10 minutes then divide the dough into 6-8 balls depending on the size you want for your feteer. Warm up the butter/ghee or oil you are using and pour into a deep bowl. Immerse the dough balls into the warm butter. Let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 550F. Stretch the first ball with your hands on a clean countertop. Stretch it as thin as you can, the goal here is to see your countertop through the dough. Fold the dough over itself to form a square brushing in between folds with the butter mixture. Set aside and start making the next ball. Stretch the second one thin as we have done for the first ball. Place the previous one on the middle seam side down. Fold the outer one over brushing with more butter mixture as you fold. Set aside. Keep doing this for the third and fourth balls. Now we have one ready, place on a 10 inch baking/pie dish seam side down and brush the top with more butter. Repeat for the remaining 4 balls to make a second one. With your hands lightly press the folded feteer to spread it on the baking dish. Place in preheated oven for 10 minutes when the feteer starts puffing turn on the broiler to brown the top. When it is done add little butter on top and cover so it won\u2019t get dry.",

        "strArea": "American",
        "strInstructions": "Make the mac and cheese 1. Bring a medium saucepan of generously salted water (you want it to taste like seawater) to a boil. Add the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes, or according to the package directions. The pasta should be tender but still chewy. 2. While the pasta is cooking, in a small bowl, whisk together the flour, mustard powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper. 3. Drain the pasta in a colander. Place the empty pasta pan (no need to wash it) over low heat and add the butter. When the butter has melted, whisk in the flour mixture and continue to cook, whisking frequently, until the mixture is beginning to brown and has a pleasant, nutty aroma, about 1 minute. Watch carefully so it does not scorch on the bottom of the pan. 4. Slowly whisk the milk and cream into the flour mixture until everything is really well combined. Cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce is heated through and just begins to thicken, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Gradually add the cheese while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula and keep stirring until the cheese has melted into the sauce. Then stir in the drained cooked pasta. 5. Line a 9-by-13-inch (23-by-33-centimeter) rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Coat the paper or foil with nonstick cooking spray or slick it with butter. Pour the warm mac and cheese onto the prepared baking sheet and spread it evenly with a spatula. Coat another piece of parchment paper with cooking spray or butter and place it, oiled or buttered side down, directly on the surface of the mac and cheese. Refrigerate until cool and firm, about 1 hour. Make the grilled cheese 6. Heat a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. 7. In a small bowl, stir together the 4 tbsp (55 grams) butter and garlic powder until well blended. 8. Remove the mac and cheese from the refrigerator and peel off the top layer of parchment paper. Carefully cut into 8 equal pieces. Each piece will make 1 grilled mac and cheese sandwich. (You can stash each individual portion in a double layer of resealable plastic bags and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 1 month.) 9. Spread 3/4 tsp garlic butter on one side of each bread slice. Place half of the slices, buttered-side down, on a clean cutting board. Top each with one slice of Cheddar, then 1 piece of the mac and cheese. (Transfer from the baking sheet by scooting your hand or a spatula under each piece of mac and cheese and then flipping it over onto a sandwich.) Place 1 slice of Jack on top of each. Finish with the remaining bread slices, buttered-side up. 10. Using a wide spatula, place as many sandwiches in the pan as will fit without crowding it. Cover and cook until the bottoms are nicely browned, about 4 minutes. Turn and cook until the second sides are browned, the cheese is melted, and the mac and cheese is heated through, about 4 minutes more. 11. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Cut the sandwiches in half, if desired, and serve.",

Make sure you use the right flour which is basically one with raising agents. Adjust the amount of sugar to your taste and try using different flavours to have variety whenever you have them. You can use Coconut milk instead of regular milk, you can also add desiccated coconut to the dry flour or other spices like powdered clove or cinnamon. For \u201chealthy looking\u201d mandazis do not roll the dough too thin before frying and use the procedure I have indicated above. 1. Mix the flour,cinnamon and sugar in a suitable bowl. 2. In a separate bowl whisk the egg into the milk 3. Make a well at the centre of the flour and add the milk and egg mixture and slowly mix to form a dough. 4. Knead the dough for 3-4 minutes or until it stops sticking to the sides of the bowl and you have a smooth surface. 5. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and allow to rest for 15 minutes. 6. Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 1cm thick piece. 7. Using a sharp small knife, cut the dough into the desired size setting aside ready for deep frying. 8. Heat your oil in a suitable pot and gently dip the mandazi pieces to cook until light brown on the first side then turn to cook on the second side. 9. Serve them warm or cold",

Toss on one side of a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4 servings, spread potato out across entire sheet.) Roast on top rack for 5 minutes (we'll add the broccoli then).  2. Meanwhile, cut broccoli florets into bite-size pieces, if necessary. Peel and finely chop garlic. In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine 1 tbsp olive oil (2 tbsp for 4 servings) and half the garlic. Microwave until garlic sizzles, 30 seconds.  3. Once potato have roasted 5 minutes, remove sheet from oven and add broccoli to empty side; carefully toss with garlic oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4 servings, add broccoli to a second sheet.) Continue roasting until potato and broccoli are browned and crispy, 15-20 minutes more.  4. While veggies roast, pat chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 5-6 minutes per side. (If chicken browns too quickly, reduce heat to medium.) Turn off heat; set chicken aside to rest. Wash out pan.  5. Heat pan used for chicken over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of oil and remaining garlic; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Stir in vinegar, honey, stock concentrate, and 1/4 cup water (1/3 cup for 4 servings). Simmer until thick and glossy, 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1 tbsp butter (2 tbsp for 4). Season with salt and pepper.  6. Return chicken to pan and turn to coat in glaze. Divide chicken, broccoli, and potato between plates. Spoon any remaining glaze over chicken and serve. ",

Pull the roasting tin out on its shelf, fill two-thirds with boiling water from the kettle, then carefully slide it back in. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Tear off a large sheet of foil and greaseproof paper (about 30 x 40cm). Sit the greaseproof on top of the foil and butter it. Tip butter, flour and vanilla seeds into a food processor; pulse until the butter has disappeared. Tip into a mixing bowl. Stir through the suet, pour in the milk and work together with a cutlery knife until you get a sticky dough. You may need a drop more milk, depending on your flour. Tip the dough out onto a floured surface, quickly pat together to smooth, then roll out to a square roughly 25 x 25cm. Spread the jam all over, leaving a gap along one edge, then roll up from the opposite edge. Pinch the jam-free edge into the dough where it meets, and pinch the ends roughly, too. Carefully lift onto the greased paper, join-side down (you might find a flat baking sheet helpful for this), loosely bring up the paper and foil around it, then scrunch together along the edges and ends to seal. The roly-poly will puff quite a bit during cooking so don\u2019t wrap it tightly. Lift the parcel directly onto the rack above the tin and cook for 1 hr. Let the pudding sit for 5 minutes before unwrapping, then carefully open the foil and paper, and thickly slice to serve.",

        "strArea": "Jamaican",
        "strInstructions": "To make the jerk marinade, combine all the ingredients in a food processor along with 1 tsp salt, and blend to a pur\u00e9e. If you\u2019re having trouble getting it to blend, just keep turning off the blender, stirring the mixture, and trying again. Eventually it will start to blend up \u2013 don\u2019t be tempted to add water, as you want a thick paste. Taste the jerk mixture for seasoning \u2013 it should taste pretty salty, but not unpleasantly, puckering salty. You can now throw in more chillies if it\u2019s not spicy enough for you. If it tastes too salty and sour, try adding in a bit more brown sugar until the mixture tastes well balanced. Make a few slashes in the chicken thighs and pour the marinade over the meat, rubbing it into all the crevices. Cover and leave to marinate overnight in the fridge. If you want to barbecue your chicken, get the coals burning 1 hr or so before you\u2019re ready to cook. Authentic jerked meats are not exactly grilled as we think of grilling, but sort of smoke-grilled. To get a more authentic jerk experience, add some wood chips to your barbecue, and cook your chicken over slow, indirect heat for 30 minutes. To cook in the oven, heat to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the chicken pieces in a roasting tin with the lime halves and cook for 45 minutes until tender and cooked through. While the chicken is cooking, prepare the rice & peas. Rinse the rice in plenty of cold water, then tip it into a large saucepan with all the remaining ingredients except the kidney beans. Season with salt, add 300ml cold water and set over a high heat. Once the rice begins to boil, turn it down to a medium heat, cover and cook for 10 minutes. Add the beans to the rice, then cover with a lid. Leave off the heat for 5 minutes until all the liquid is absorbed. Squeeze the roasted lime over the chicken and serve with the rice & peas, and some hot sauce if you like it really spicy.",

        "strInstructions": "Make the Pastry Dough To a large bowl, add flour, 1 tsp salt, and turmeric and mix thoroughly. Rub shortening into flour until there are small pieces of shortening completely covered with flour. Pour in \u00bd cup of the ice water and mix with your hands to bring the dough together. Keep adding ice water 2 to 3 tbsp at a time until the mixture forms a dough. At this stage, you can cut the dough into 2 large pieces, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes before using it. Alternatively, cut the dough into 10 to 12 equal pieces, place on a platter or baking sheet, cover securely with plastic wrap and let chill for 30 minutes while you make the filling. Make the Filling Add ground beef to a large bowl. Sprinkle in allspice and pepper. Mix together and set aside. Heat oil in a skillet until hot. Add onion and saut\u00e9 until translucent. Add hot pepper, garlic and thyme and continue to saut\u00e9 for another minute. Add 1/4 tsp salt. Add seasoned ground beef and toss to mix, breaking up any clumps, and let cook until the meat is no longer pink. Add ketchup and more salt to taste. Pour in 2 cups of water and stir. Bring the mixture to a boil then reduce heat and let simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated and whatever is remaining has reduced to a thick sauce. Fold in green onion. Remove from heat and let cool completely. Assemble the Patties Beat the egg and water together to make an egg wash. Set aside. Now you can prepare the dough in two ways. First Method: Flour the work surface and rolling pin. If you had cut it into 2 large pieces, then take one of the large pieces and roll it out into a very large circle. Take a bowl with a wide rim (about 5 inches) and cut out three circles. Place about 3 heaping tbsp of the filling onto \u00bd of each circle. Dip a finger into the water and moisten the edges of the pastry. Fold over the other half and press to seal.  Take a fork and crimp the edges. Cut off any extra to make it look neat and uniform. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and continue to work until you have rolled all the dough and filled the patties. Second Method: If you had pre-cut the dough into individual pieces, work with one piece of dough at a time. Roll it out on a floured surface into a 5-inch circle or a little larger. Don\u2019t worry if the edges are not perfect. Place 3 heaping tbsp of the filling on one side of the circle. Dip a finger into the water and moisten the edges of the pastry. Fold over the other half and press to seal. Take a fork and crimp the edges. Cut off any extra to make it look neat and uniform. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and continue work until you have rolled all the dough and filled the patties. Frying and Serving the Patties After forming the patties, place the pans in the refrigerator while you heat the oven to 350 F. Just before adding the pans with the patties to the oven, brush the patties with egg wash. Bake patties for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire racks. Serve warm.",

Stir in carrots and cook over low heat for 10 to 12 minutes. Add flour and curry powder; cook for 1 minute. Gradually stir in stock until combined; add honey, soy sauce and Bay Leaves. Slowly bring to the boil. Turn down heat and simmer for 20 minutes or until sauce thickens but is still of pouring consistency. Stir in garam masala. Pour the curry sauce through a sieve; return to saucepan and keep on low heat until ready to serve. For the chicken: Season both sides of chicken breast with salt and pepper. Place flour, egg and breadcrumbs in separate bowls and arrange in a row. Coat the chicken breast in flour, then dip them into the egg, then coat in breadcrumbs, making sure you cover both sides. Heat oil in large frying pan over medium-high heat. Place chicken into hot oil and cook until golden brown, about 3 or 4 minutes each side. Once cooked, place on kitchen paper to absorb excess oil. Pour curry sauce over chicken, serve with white rice and enjoy!",

        "strInstructions": "Cook the lentils. Bring lentils and 4 cups of water to a boil in a medium pot or saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and cook until lentils are just tender. Drain from water and season with a little salt (Note: when the lentils are ready, they should not be fully cooked. They should be only par-cooked and still have a bite to them as they need to finish cooking with the rice). Drain the rice from its soaking water. Combine the par-cooked lentils and the rice in the saucepan over medium-high heat with tbsp cooking oil, salt, pepper, and coriander. Cook while stirring regularly. Add warm water to cover the rice and lentil mixture by about 1\u00bd inches (Note: you'll probably use about 3 cups of water here). Bring to a boil; the water should reduce a bit. Now cover and cook until all the liquid has been absorbed and both the rice and lentils are well cooked through. Keep covered and undisturbed. While the rice and lentils are cooking, make the pasta according to package instructions by adding the elbow pasta to boiling water with a dash of salt and a little oil. Cook until the pasta is al dente. Drain. Cover the chickpeas and warm in the microwave briefly before serving. Sprinkle the onion rings with salt, then toss them in the flour to coat. Shake off excess flour. In a large skillet, heat the cooking oil over medium-high heat, cook the onion rings, stirring often, until they turn a nice caramelized brown. onion must be crispy.",

        "strInstructions": "Use pickled vine leaves here, preserved in brine. Small delicate leaves are better than the large bristly ones but, if only large leaves are to hand, then trim them to roughly 12 by 12 cms so that you don't get too many layers of leaves around the filling. And remove any stalks. Drain the preserved leaves, immerse them in boiling water for 10 minutes and then leave to dry on a tea towel before use. Basmati rice with butter and pine nuts is an ideal accompaniment. Couscous is great, too. Serves four. First make the filling. Put all the ingredients, apart from the tomato, in a bowl. Cut the tomato in half, coarsely grate into the bowl and discard the skins. Add half a tsp of salt and some pepper, and stir. Leave on the side, or in the fridge, for up to a day. Before using, gently squeeze with your hands and drain away any juices that come out. To make the sauce, heat the oil in a medium pan. Add the ginger and garlic, cook for a minute or two, taking care not to burn them, then add the tomato, lemon juice and sugar. Season, and simmer for 20 minutes. While the sauce is bubbling away, prepare the vine leaves. Use any torn or broken leaves to line the base of a wide, heavy saucepan. Trim any leaves from the fennel, cut it vertically into 0\u00bdcm-thick slices and spread over the base of the pan to cover completely. Lay a prepared vine leaf (see intro) on a work surface, veiny side up. Put two tsp of filling at the base of the leaf in a 2cm-long by 1cm-wide strip. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it tightly from bottom to top, in a cigar shape. Place in the pan, seam down, and repeat with the remaining leaves, placing them tightly next to each other in lines or circles (in two layers if necessary). Pour the sauce over the leaves (and, if needed, add water just to cover). Place a plate on top, to weigh the leaves down, then cover with a lid. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook on a bare simmer for 70 minutes. Most of the liquid should evaporate. Remove from the heat, and leave to cool a little - they are best served warm. When serving, bring to the table in the pan - it looks great. Serve a few vine leaves and fennel slices with warm rice. Spoon the braising juices on top and garnish with coriander.",

        "strInstructions": "Grind the cashew, poppy seeds and cumin seeds into a smooth paste, using as little water as possible. Set aside.  Deep fry the sliced onion when it is hot. Don\u2019t overcrowd the oil. When the onion turn light brown, remove from oil and drain on paper towel. The fried onion will crisp up as it drains. Also fry the cashewnuts till golden brown. Set aside. Wash the rice and soak in water for twenty minutes. Meanwhile, take a big wide pan, add oil in medium heat, add the sliced onion, add the blended paste, to it add the green chillies, ginger garlic paste and garlic and fry for a minute. Then add the tomato and saut\u00e9 them well till they are cooked and not mushy. Then to it add the chilli powder, biryani powder, mint, coriander leaves and saut\u00e9 them well. Add the yogurt and mix well. I always move the skillet away from the heat when adding yogurt which prevents it from curdling. Now after returning the skillet back to the stove, add the washed lamb and salt and \u00bd cup water and mix well. Cook for 1 hour and cook it covered in medium low heat or put it in a pressure cooker for 6 whistles. If the water is not drained totally, heat it by keeping it open. Take another big pan, add thrice the cup of rice you use, and boil it. When it is boiling high, add the rice, salt and jeera and mix well. After 7 minutes exact or when the rice is 80% done. Switch off and drain the rice. Now, the layering starts. To the lamb, pat and level it. Add the drained hot rice on the top of it. Garnish with fried onion, ghee, mint, coriander leaves and saffron dissolved in milk. Cover the dish and bake in a 350F (175C) oven for 15 minutes or till the cooked but not mushy. Or cook in the stove medium heat for 12 minutes and lowest heat for 5 minutes. And switch off. Mix and serve hot! Notes 1. If you are cooking in oven, do make sure to cook in a big oven safe pan and cover it tight and then keep in oven for the final step. 2. You can skip biryani masala if you don\u2019t have and add just garam masala (1 tsp and chilli powder \u2013 3 tsp instead of 1 tsp) 3. If it is spicy in the end, squeeze some lemon, it will reduce the heat and enhance the flavors also.",

Add the onion, celery and carrots, and cook over a medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened. Add the garlic and cook for 1 min, then tip in the mince and cook, stirring and breaking it up with a wooden spoon, for about 6 minutes until browned all over. Stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e and cook for 1 min, mixing in well with the beef and vegetables. Tip in the tomato. Fill each can half full with water to rinse out any tomato left in the can, and add to the pan. Add the honey and season to taste. Simmer for 20 minutes. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. To assemble the lasagne, ladle a little of the ragu sauce into the bottom of the roasting tin or casserole dish, spreading the sauce all over the base. Place 2 sheets of lasagne on top of the sauce overlapping to make it fit, then repeat with more sauce and another layer of pasta. Repeat with a further 2 layers of sauce and pasta, finishing with a layer of pasta. Put the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche in a bowl and mix with 2 tbsp water to loosen it and make a smooth pourable sauce. Pour this over the top of the pasta, then top with the mozzarella. Sprinkle Parmesan over the top and bake for 25\u201330 minutes until golden and bubbling. Serve scattered with basil, if you like.",

        "strInstructions": "Soak the dried mushrooms in 350ml boiling water and set aside until needed. Blitz \u00be of the chestnuts with 150ml water until creamy. Roughly chop the remaining chestnuts. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Fry the shallots with a pinch of salt until softened, then add the garlic, chopped chestnuts and rosemary, and fry for 2 minutes more. Add the wild mushrooms, 2 tbsp oil and some seasoning. Cook for 3 minutes until they begin to soften. Drain and roughly chop the dried mushrooms (reserve the soaking liquid), then add those too, along with the soy sauce, and fry for 2 minutes more. Whisk the wine, reserved mushroom liquid and chestnut cream together to create a sauce. Season, then add half to the mushroom mixture in the pan and cook for 1 min until the sauce becomes glossy. Remove and discard the rosemary sprigs, then set the mixture aside. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and get a large bowl of ice water ready. Drop the lasagne sheets into the boiling water for 2 minutes or until pliable and a little cooked, then immediately plunge them into the cold water. Using your fingers, carefully separate the sheets and transfer to a clean tea towel. Spread a good spoonful of the sauce on the bottom two thirds of each sheet, then, rolling away from yourself, roll up the shorter ends. Cut each roll in half, then position the rolls of pasta cut-side up in a pie dish that you are happy to serve from at the table. If you have any mushroom sauce remaining after you\u2019ve rolled up all the sheets, simply push it into some of the exposed rolls of pasta. Pour the rest of the sauce over the top of the pasta, then bake for 10 minutes or until the pasta no longer has any resistance when tested with a skewer. Meanwhile, put the breadcrumbs, the last 2 tbsp olive oil, sage leaves and some seasoning in a bowl, and toss everything together. Scatter the rotolo with the crumbs and sage, then bake for another 10 minutes, until the top is golden and the sage leaves are crispy. Leave to cool for 10 minutes to allow the pasta to absorb the sauce, then drizzle with a little truffle oil, if you like, before taking your dish to the table.",

        "strInstructions": "Heat a large frying pan and toast the cumin seeds for a few minutes, then set aside. Heat the oil in the same pan and fry the onion, garlic, chilli, pepper and a good pinch of salt for around eight minutes, until there is no moisture left. Remove from the heat, stir in the toasted cumin seeds, ground mace (or nutmeg) and ground coriander. Leave to cool. In a large bowl mix together the minced lamb, white pepper, fresh coriander, and the cooled spiced onion mixture until combined. Set aside, covered, in the fridge. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and generously grease a 20cm/8in diameter loose-bottomed or springform round cake tin with lard. To make the pastry, sift the flour and salt in a large bowl and make a well in the centre. Put the milk, lard and 90ml/3fl oz of water in a saucepan and heat gently. When the lard has melted, increase the heat and bring to the boil. Pour the boiling liquid into the flour, and use a wooden spoon to combine until cool enough to handle. Bring together into a ball. Dust a work surface with flour and, working quickly, knead the dough briefly \u2013 it will be soft and moist. Set aside a third of the pastry and roll the rest out on a well-floured surface. Line the pie dish with the pastry, pressing it right up the sides until it pokes just over the top of the tin. Add the filling into the pastry-lined tin bit by bit. As you reach the top, form a slight peak. Roll out the reserved pastry and top the pie with it. Pinch the edges to seal and trim the excess. Poke a hole in the top of the pie and insert a small tube made from aluminium foil to allow steam to escape. Brush the top of the pie with a little beaten egg yolk, and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes (put a tray on the shelf below to catch any drips). Then reduce the temperature to 160C/325F/Gas 3 and cook for a further 1\u00bc hours until golden-brown. Leave to cool completely before refrigerating for two hours, or overnight. Run a knife around the edge of the pie, remove from the tin and serve with chutneys, salads or pickles.",

Combine the pastry into a ball \u2013 don\u2019t add liquid \u2013 and knead it briefly. The dough will be fairly firm, like shortbread dough. You can use the dough immediately, or chill for later. Preheat the oven to 200C/gas 6/fan 180C. Line 18 holes of two 12-hole patty tins, by pressing small walnut-sized balls of pastry into each hole. Spoon 280g mincemeat into the pies. Take slightly smaller balls of pastry than before and pat them out between your hands to make round lids, big enough to cover the pies.  Top the pies with their lids, pressing the edges gently together to seal \u2013 you don\u2019t need to seal them with milk or egg as they will stick on their own. (The pies may now be frozen for up to 1 month). Beat 1 small egg and brush the tops of the pies. Bake for 20 minutes until golden. Leave to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then remove to a wire rack. To serve, lightly dust with icing sugar.",

For the crust, melt the butter in a medium pan. Stir in the biscuit crumbs and sugar so the mixture is evenly moistened. Press the mixture into the bottom of the pan and bake for 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack while preparing the filling. For the filling, increase the oven temperature to fan 200C/conventional 240C/gas 9. In a table top mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the soft cheese at medium-low speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. With the mixer on low, gradually add the sugar, then the flour and a pinch of salt, scraping down the sides of the bowl and the paddle twice. Swap the paddle attachment for the whisk. Continue by adding the vanilla, lemon zest and juice. Whisk in the egg and yolk, one at a time, scraping the bowl and whisk at least twice. Stir the 284ml carton of soured cream until smooth, then measure 200ml/7fl oz (just over 3\u20444 of the carton). Continue on low speed as you add the measured soured cream (reserve the rest). Whisk to blend, but don't over-beat. The batter should be smooth, light and somewhat airy. Brush the sides of the springform tin with melted butter and put on a baking sheet. Pour in the filling - if there are any lumps, sink them using a knife - the top should be as smooth as possible. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to fan 90C/conventional 110C/gas 1\u20444 and bake for 25 minutes more. If you gently shake the tin, the filling should have a slight wobble. Turn off the oven and open the oven door for a cheesecake that's creamy in the centre, or leave it closed if you prefer a drier texture. Let cool in the oven for 2 hours. The cheesecake may get a slight crack on top as it cools. Combine the reserved soured cream with the 142ml carton, the sugar and lemon juice for the topping. Spread over the cheesecake right to the edges. Cover loosely with foil and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight. Run a round-bladed knife around the sides of the tin to loosen any stuck edges. Unlock the side, slide the cheesecake off the bottom of the tin onto a plate, then slide the parchment paper out from underneath.",

Whisk in the egg for 2 to 3 minutes until the mixture has thickened. Remove from heat and mix in the biscuit crumbs, coconut and almonds if using, then press into the base of a lined 20cm square tin. Chill for 10 minutes. For the middle layer, make the custard icing; whisk together the butter, cream and custard powder until light and fluffy, then gradually add the icing sugar until fully incorporated. Spread over the bottom layer and chill in the fridge for at least 10 minutes until the custard is no longer soft. Melt the chocolate and butter together in the microwave, then spread over the chilled bars and put back in the fridge. Leave until the chocolate has fully set (about 2 hrs). Take the mixture out of the tin and slice into squares to serve.",

        "strInstructions": "Heat the oven to 300 degrees. Dredging the shanks: pour the flour into a shallow dish (a pie plate works nicely). Season the veal shanks on all sides with salt and pepper. One at a time, roll the shanks around in the flour coat, and shake and pat the shank to remove any excuses flour. Discard the remaining flour. Browning the shanks: put the oil and 1 tbsp of the butter in a wide Dutch oven or heavy braising pot (6 to 7 quart) and heat over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted and the oil is shimmering, lower the shanks into the pot, flat side down; if the shanks won\u2019t fit without touching one another, do this in batches. Brown the shanks, turning once with tongs, until both flat sides are well caramelized, about 5 minutes per side. If the butter-oil mixture starts to burn, lower the heat just a bit. Transfer the shanks to a large platter or tray and set aside. The aromatics: pour off and discard the fat from the pot. Wipe out any burnt bits with a damp paper towel, being careful not to remove any delicious little caramelized bits. Ad the remaining 2 tbsp butter to the pot and melt it over medium heat. When the butter has stopped foaming, add the onion, carrots, celery, and fennel. Season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook the vegetables until they begin to soften but do not brown, about 6 minutes. Stir in the garlic, orange zest, marjoram, and Bay Leaves, and stew for another minute or two. The braising liquid: add the wine, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Boil, stirring occasionally, to reduce the wine by about half, 5 minutes. Add the stock and tomato, with their juice, and boil again to reduce the liquid to about 1 cup total, about 10 minutes. The braise: Place the shanks in the pot so that they are sitting with the exposed bone facing up, and pour over any juices that accumulated as they sat. Cover with parchment paper, pressing down so the parchment nearly touches the veal and the edges hang over the sides of the pot by about an inch. Cover tightly with the lid, and slide into the lower part of the oven to braise at a gentle simmer. Check the pot after the first 15 minutes, and if the liquid is simmering too aggressively, lower the oven heat by 10 or 15 degrees. Continue braising, turning the shanks and spooning some pan juices over the top after the first 40 minutes, until the meat is completely tender and pulling away from the bone, about 2 hours. The gremolata: While the shanks are braising, stir together the garlic, parsley, and lemon zest in a small bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a cool place (or the refrigerator, if your kitchen is very warm.) The finish: When the veal is fork-tender and falling away from the bone, remove the lid and sprinkle over half of the gremolata. Return the veal to the oven, uncovered, for another 15 minutes to caramelize it some. Using a slotted spatula or spoon, carefully lift the shanks from the braising liquid, doing your best to keep them intact. The shanks will be very tender and threatening to fall into pieces, and the marrow will be wobbly inside the bones, so this can be a bit tricky. But if they do break apart, don\u2019t worry, the flavor won\u2019t suffer at all. Arrange the shanks on a serving platter or other large plate, without stacking, and cover with foil to keep warm. Finishing the sauce: Set the braising pot on top of the stove and evaluate the sauce: if there is a visible layer of fat floating on the surface, use a large spoon to skim it off and discard it. Taste the sauce for concentration of flavor. If it tastes a bit weak or flat, bring it to a boil over high heat, and boil to reduce the volume and intensify the flavor for 5 to 10 minutes. Taste again for salt and pepper. If the sauce wants more zip, stir in a tsp or two of the remaining gremolata. Portioning the veal shanks: if the shanks are reasonably sized, serve one per person. If the shanks are gargantuan or you\u2019re dealing with modest appetites, pull apart the larger shanks, separating them at their natural seams, and serve smaller amounts. Be sure to give the marrow bones to whomever prizes them most. Serving: Arrange the veal shanks on warm dinner plates accompanied by the risotto, if serving. Just before carrying the plates to the table, sprinkle on the remaining gremolata and then spoon over a generous amount of sauce \u2013 the contact with the hot liquid will aromatize the gremolata and perk up everyone\u2019s appetite with the whiff of garlic and lemon.",

Stir occasionally and add the beans with 30 minutes to go. Remove the pan from the oven and heat the grill. Scatter the top with the remaining herbs and breadcrumbs, drizzle a little oil over the top, and return to the oven for 5-10 minutes, until the breadcrumbs are golden.

Tip the sugar, butter, star anise, cardamom and cinnamon into an ovenproof frying pan, about 20cm wide, and place over a high heat until bubbling. Shake the pan and stir the buttery sauce until it separates and the sugar caramelises to a toffee colour. Lay the pears in the pan, then cook in the sauce for 10-12 minutes, tossing occasionally, until completely caramelised. Don\u2019t worry about them burning \u2013 they won\u2019t \u2013 but you want to caramelise them as much as possible. Splash in the brandy and let it flamb\u00e9, then set the pears aside. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Roll the pastry out to the thickness of a \u00a31 coin. Using a plate slightly larger than the top of the pan, cut out a circle, then press the edges of the circle of pastry to thin them out. When the pears have cooled slightly, arrange them in the pan, cut side up, in a floral shape, with the pears around the edge pointing inwards. Rest the cinnamon stick on the top in the centre, with the cardamom pods scattered around. Drape the pastry over the pears, then tuck the edges down the pan sides and under the fruit (see Gordon\u2019s guide). Pierce the pastry a few times, then bake for 15 minutes. If a lot of juice bubbles up the side of the pan, pour it off at this stage (see guide). Reduce oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4 and bake for 15 minutes more until the pastry is golden. Leave the tart to stand for 10 minutes, then invert it carefully onto a serving dish.",

Add the roasted peppers to the other bowl of egg with the garlic, chilli, salt and pepper. Heat a little oil in a 20-23cm frying pan, preferably non-stick. Pour the egg with courgette into a measuring jug, then pourabout one-third of the mixture into the pan, swirling it to cover the base of the pan. Cook until the egg is set and lightly browned underneath, then cover the pan with a plate and invert the omelette onto it. Slide it back into the pan to cook the other side. Repeat with the remaining mix to make two more omelettes, adding a little oil to the pan each time. Stack the omelettes onto a plate. Make three omelettes in the same way with the red pepper mixture, then stack them on a separate plate. Now make the filling. Beat the cheese to soften it, then beat in the milk to make a spreadable consistency. Stir in the herbs, salt and pepper. Line a deep, 20-23cm round cake tin with cling film (use a tin the same size as the frying pan). Select the best red pepper omelette and place in the tin, prettiest side down. Spread with a thin layer of cheese filling, then cover with a courgette omelette. Repeat, alternating the layers, until all the omelettes and filling are in the tin, finishing with an omelette. Flip the cling film over the omelette, then chill for up to 24 hrs. To serve, invert the omelette cake onto a serving plate and peel off the cling film. Pile rocket on the top and scatter over the cheese, a drizzle of olive oil and a little freshly ground pepper. Serve cut into wedges.",

Add the onion, fennel and carrots and cook for about 10 minutes until the veg start to soften. Pour in the wine and brandy, bubble hard for about 1 min to drive off the alcohol, then add the tomato, stock and paprika. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, chop the prawns. Blitz the soup as finely as you can with a stick blender or food processor, then press through a sieve into a bowl. Spend a bit of time really working the mixture through the sieve as this will give the soup its velvety texture. Tip back into a clean pan, add the prawns and cook for 10 minutes, then blitz again until smooth. You can make and chill this a day ahead or freeze it for 1 month. Thaw ovenight in the fridge. To serve, gently reheat in a pan with the cream. If garnishing, cook the 8 prawns in a little butter. Spoon into small bowls and top with the prawns and snipped fennel fronds.",

Put the onion, rutabaga, and beef through a meat grinder twice if you have one, if not just chop them up as fine as possible. Melt the remaining 4 tbsp butter over medium heat, and add the meat mixture. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until all of the liquid has evaporated and the mixture is thick enough to hold its shape. Remove from heat and let cool, then stir in 1 egg, and season with salt and pepper. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a 13x8\" rectangle (1/8\" thick). Spoon the filling down the center of the rectangle lengthwise, leaving about an inch of space on each end. Lightly brush the long sides with cold water, then fold one of the long sides over the filling and the other side over the top of that. Brush the short ends with cold water and fold them over the top, enclosing the filling. Place pastry seam side down on a baking sheet and brush the top evenly with the remaining scrambled egg.

This will make more than you\u2019ll need for the recipe but will keep for a week in an airtight jar.  Heat a griddle or frying pan to high. Brush away the garlic and parsley stalks from the steaks and season well. Sear the steaks for 2 minutes on each side then rest on a plate. Put the ciabatta halves onto the plate, toasted-side down, to soak up any juices.  Slice the steaks then stuff into the rolls with the green sauce and rocket.",

        "strArea": "Portuguese",
        "strInstructions": " Cut the tenderloins into 5 equal-size pieces leaving the tail ends a little longer. Take a clear plastic bag and slip one of the pieces in. Bash it into an escalope the size of a side-plate with a rolling pin and repeat with the remaining pieces.  Put the wine, paprika, some salt and pepper and the juice of \u00bd a lemon in a bowl and add the pork. Leave to marinate for 20-30 minutes, while you get your barbecue to the stage where the coals are glowing but there are no flames.  To make the chips, fill a basin with cool water and cut the potato into 3cm-thick chips. Soak them in the water for 5 minutes and then change the water. Leave for 5 more minutes. Drain and then pat dry on a towel or with kitchen paper.  Heat the oil in a deep fryer or a deep heavy-based pan with a lid to 130C and lower the chips into the oil (in batches). Blanch for 8-10 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain well. Place on a tray to cool. Reheat the oil to 180C (make sure it\u2019s hot or your chips will be soggy) and lower the basket of chips into the oil (again, do this in batches). Leave to cook for 2 minutes and then give them a little shake. Cook for another minute or so until they are well coloured and crisp to the touch. Drain well for a few minutes, tip into a bowl and sprinkle with sea salt.  The pork will cook quickly so do it in 2 batches. Take the pieces out of the marinade, rub them with oil, and drop them onto the barbecue (you could also use a chargrill). Cook for 1 minute on each side \u2013 they may flare up as you do so. This should really be enough time as they will keep on cooking. Take them off the barbecue and pile onto a plate. Repeat with the remaining batch.  Serve by piling a plate with chips, drop the pork on top of each pile and pouring the juices from the plate over so the chips take up the flavours. Top with a spoon of mayonnaise and a wedge of lemon.",

Add the sausage pieces and fry on a medium-high heat for 10 minutes, stirring regularly, until golden-brown all over. Transfer the sausages to a plate, then add the onion and fennel to the hot pan and fry for 15 minutes, stirring once in a while, until soft and caramelised; if the pan goes a bit dry, add a tsp or so of extra oil. Stir in the paprika, garlic and half the fennel seeds, fry for two minutes more, then pour on the wine and boil for 30 seconds, to reduce by half. Add the tomato, sugar, 100ml water, the seared sausage and half a tsp of salt, cover and simmer for 30 minutes; remove the lid after 10 minutes, and cook until the sauce is thick and rich. Remove from the heat, stir through the olives and remaining fennel seeds and set aside until you\u2019re ready to serve. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook for 12-14 minutes (or according to the instructions on the packet), until al dente. Meanwhile, reheat the sauce. Drain the pasta, return it to the pot, stir in a tbsp of oil, then divide between the bowls.  Put all the pesto ingredients except the basil in the small bowl of a food processor. Add a tbsp of water and blitz to a rough paste. Add the basil, then blitz until just combined (the pesto has a much better texture if the basil is not overblended). Spoon over the rag\u00f9 and top with a spoonful of pesto. Finish with a sprinkling of chopped fennel fronds, if you have any, and serve at once.",

If the masala paste is thin then it would not stick to the fish. Rinse the fish slit from the center and give some incision from the top. You could see the fish below for clarity. Now stuff the paste into the center and into the incision. Coat the entire fish with this paste. Marinate the fish for 30 minutes. Place oil in a shallow pan, once oil is quite hot shallow fry the stuffed mackerels. Fry until golden brown from both sides Serve the recheado mackerels hot with salad, lime wedges, rice and curry. Notes 1. Ensure the masala paste is thick else the result won't be good. 2. If you aren't able to find kashmiri chillies then use bedgi chillies or kashmiri chilli powder. 3. You could use white vinegar or coconut vinegar. 4. Any left over paste could be stored in the fridge for future use. 5. Cinnamon could be avoided as it's a strong spice used generally for meat or chicken.",

When it\u2019s hot, add onion, carrots, celery and garlic; sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Heat the oven to 500 degrees. Drain the beans; if they\u2019re canned, rinse them as well. Add them to the pot along with tomato and their juices and stock, rosemary and thyme. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat so the soup bubbles steadily; cover and cook, stirring once or twice to break up the tomato, until the flavors meld, 15 to 20 minutes. Fish out and discard rosemary and thyme stems, if you like, and stir in kale. Taste and adjust seasoning. Lay bread slices on top of the stew so they cover the top and overlap as little as possible. Scatter red onion slices over the top, drizzle with the remaining 3 tbsp oil and sprinkle with Parmesan. Put the pot in the oven and bake until the bread, onion and cheese are browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. (If your pot fits under the broiler, you can also brown the top there.) Divide the soup and bread among 4 bowls and serve.",

        "strInstructions": " For the Lentils: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F to prepare for roasting eggplant. Meanwhile, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add carrots, celery, and onion and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add lentils, bay leaves, stock or water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer, cover with the lid partially ajar, and cook until lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. (Top up with water if lentils are at any point not fully submerged.) Remove lid, stir in vinegar, and reduce until lentils are moist but not soupy. Season to taste with salt and pepper, cover, and keep warm until ready to serve. 2. For the Eggplant: While lentils cook, cut each eggplant in half. Score flesh with the tip of a paring knife in a cross-hatch pattern at 1-inch intervals. Transfer to a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, cut side up, and brush each eggplant half with 1 tbsp oil, letting each brushstroke be fully absorbed before brushing with more. Season with salt and pepper. Place a rosemary sprig on top of each one. Transfer to oven and roast until completely tender and well charred, 25 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven and discard rosemary. 3. To Serve: Heat 2 tbsp olive oil and pine nuts in a medium skillet set over medium heat. Cook, tossing nuts frequently, until golden brown and aromatic, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl to halt cooking. Stir half of parsley and rosemary into lentils and transfer to a serving platter. Arrange eggplant halves on top. Spread a few tbsp of tahini sauce over each eggplant half and sprinkle with pine nuts. Sprinkle with remaining parsley and rosemary, drizzle with additional olive oil, and serve.",

        "strInstructions": "Wash and rinse the dried kidney beans.. then cover with water in a deep bowl. Remember as they soak they will expand to at least triple the size they were originally so add a lot of water to the bowl. Soak them overnight or for at least 2 hrs to make the cooking step go quicker. I tossed out the water they were soaked in after it did the job. Have your butcher cut the salted pigtail into 2 inch pieces as it will be very difficult to cut with an ordinary kitchen knife. Wash, then place a deep pot with water and bring to a boil. Cook for 20 minutes, then drain + rinse and repeat (boil again in water). The goal is to make the pieces of pig tails tender and to remove most of the salt it was cured in. Time to start the soup. Place everything in the pot (except the flour and potato), then cover with water and place on a high flame to bring to a boil. As it comes to a boil, skim off any scum/froth at the top and discard. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil and allow it to cook for 1 hr and 15 minutes.. basically until the beans are tender and start falling apart. It\u2019s now time to add the potato (and Yams etc if you\u2019re adding it) as well as the coconut milk and continue cooking for 15 minutes. Now is a good time to start making the basic dough for the spinner dumplings. Mix the flour and water (add a pinch of salt if you want) until you have a soft/smooth dough. allow it to rest for 5 minutes, then pinch of a tbsp at a time and roll between your hands to form a cigarette shape. Add them to the pot, stir well and continue cooking for another 15 minutes on a rolling boil. You\u2019ll notice that I didn\u2019t add any salt to the pot as the remaining salt from the salted pigtails will be enough to properly season this dish. However you can taste and adjust accordingly. Lets recap the timing part of things so you\u2019re not confused. Cook the base of the soup for 1 hr and 15 minute or until tender, then add the potato and cook for 15 minutes, then add the dumplings and cook for a further 15 minutes. Keep in mind that this soup will thicken quite a bit as it cools. While this is not a traditional recipe to any one specific island, versions of this soup (sometimes called stewed peas) can be found throughout the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa. A hearty bowl of this soup will surely give you the sleepies (some may call it ethnic fatigue). You can certainly freeze the leftovers and heat it up another day.",

When the mixture will not be mixing well, and will look like wood chips, put away the blending mixer and using your hands knead the dough. Create a roll and cover in foil and freeze for 15 minutes. At this time preheat the oven to 375. Take the dough out and separate into two. Roll and cut out 3 inch trangles. Make as many as you can and on centre of each put a small spoon of jam. Roll them into a croissant shape. Place the croissants onto a greased cookie sheet, and bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden. Repeat with the rest of the dough. When you take them out, put aside and sprinkle with powdered sugar on top. This makes about 3 batches of 20 cookies each. Total count about 60 cookies.",

Bring them to the boil then turn down to a simmer and let cook (uncovered) for 20-30 minutes, or until tender. Drain and set aside. While the lentils are cooking heat the 1 tbsp of oil on low in a medium pot. Add the onion and leeks and saut\u00e9 for 5 or so minutes, or until they begin to soften. Add the garlic next along with the cumin and coriander, cooking for a few more minutes. Add the remaining spices \u2013 paprika, cinnamon, chilli, cocoa, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and oregano. Next add the can of tomato, the water or stock, and carrots. Let simmer, covered, for 20 minutes or until the veg is tender and the mixture has thickened up. You\u2019ll need to check on the pot periodically for a stir and a top of of liquid if needed. Add the lentils and chopped roasted squash. Let cook for 10 more minutes to heat through. Serve with sliced jalapeno, lime wedges, cilantro, green onion, and cashew sour cream. Bring some water to the boil, and use it to soak the cashews for at least four hours. Alternatively, you can use cold water and let the cashews soak overnight. After the cashews have soaked, drain them and add to a high speed blender. Begin to puree, slowly adding about \u00bd cup fresh water, until a creamy consistency is reached. May need to add less or more water to reach the desired consistency. Add a pinch of sea salt and vinegar (or lemon juice).",

        "strInstructions": "Stone and chop the dates quite small, put them in a bowl, then pour the boiling water over. Leave for about 30 minutes until cool and well-soaked, then mash a bit with a fork. Stir in the vanilla extract. Butter and flour seven mini pudding tins (each about 200ml/7fl oz) and sit them on a baking sheet. Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. While the dates are soaking, make the puddings. Mix the flour and bicarbonate of soda together and beat the egg in a separate bowl. Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl for a few minutes until slightly creamy (the mixture will be grainy from the sugar). Add the egg a little at a time, beating well between additions. Beat in the black treacle then, using a large metal spoon, gently fold in one-third of the flour, then half the milk, being careful not to overbeat. Repeat until all the flour and milk is used. Stir the soaked dates into the pudding batter. The mix may look a little curdled at this point and will be like a soft, thick batter. Spoon it evenly between the tins and bake for 20-25 minutes, until risen and firm. Meanwhile, put the sugar and butter for the sauce in a medium saucepan with half the cream. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, stirring all the time, until the sugar has completely dissolved. Stir in the black treacle, turn up the heat slightly and let the mixture bubble away for 2-3 minutes until it is a rich toffee colour, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn\u2019t burn. Take the pan off the heat and beat in the rest of the cream. Remove the puddings from the oven. Leave in the tins for a few minutes, then loosen them well from the sides of the tins with a small palette knife before turning them out. You can serve them now with the sauce drizzled over, but they\u2019ll be even stickier if left for a day or two coated in the sauce. To do this, pour about half the sauce into one or two ovenproof serving dishes. Sit the upturned puddings on the sauce, then pour the rest of the sauce over them. Cover with a loose tent of foil so that the sauce doesn\u2019t smudge (no need to chill). When ready to serve, heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Warm the puddings through, still covered, for 15-20 minutes or until the sauce is bubbling. Serve them on their own, or with cream or custard.",

(there will probably be sufficient saltiness from the salmon to not need to add salt) Stir gently to heat through Serve scattered with the Parmesan and seasonal vegetables. Grill the salmon and gently place onto the risotto with the prawns and asparagus",

If you don\u2019t mix it enough it will not set well enough, but don\u2019t get impatient and whisk it really quick because that\u2019ll make it split! Spread over the biscuit base and leave to set in the fridge overnight. 4) Remove the Cheesecake from the tin carefully and decorate the cheesecake \u2013 I drizzled over some of the spare caramel, and then some Toffee Popcorn and more Pretzels!",

        "strInstructions": "Boil the kettle. Empty the mussels into a colander and run under cold water. Throw away any with broken shells. Pick through the shells, tapping each one on the side of the sink \u2013 they should be closed or should slowly close when tapped \u2013 if they stay open, throw them away. If any of the shells still have barnacles or stringy beards attached, pull them off with a cutlery knife and rinse the shells well. Keep in the colander, covered with a cold, damp cloth, until you\u2019re ready to cook. Peel the prawn shells on the body section only \u2013 leave the heads and tails intact. Score down the backs and pull out any gritty entrails. Chill until you\u2019re ready to cook. Put the saffron in a small cup, cover with 50ml kettle-hot water and set aside for 10 minutes. If using vermicelli, put in a bowl and crush to little pieces (about 1cm long) with your hands. Heat the oil in a large frying pan with at least a 3cm lip, or a 40cm paella pan. Add the onion and stir around the pan for 5 minutes until soft. Add the garlic and cook for 1 min more, then tip in the vermicelli and cook for 5 minutes, stirring from time to time, until the vermicelli is toasted brown. Stir in the paprika. Keeping the heat moderate, stir through the monkfish, squid and saffron with its water, seasoning well. Spread the ingredients out in an even layer, then pour over the hot stock and scatter the tomato on top. Bring to a simmer, then cover the whole dish with a tight-fitting lid (or foil). Turn the heat to medium and cook for 6 minutes. Uncover and stir to incorporate the dry top layer of pasta. Push the mussels into the pasta so the hinges are buried in the bottom of the dish, and they stand straight up. Arrange the prawns on top, cover tightly and cook for another 6 minutes or until the mussels are open, the prawns are pink and the pasta is cooked through. Leave to simmer for another 2-3 minutes to cook off most of the remaining liquid (leave a little in the pan to prevent the pasta from sticking together). Allow to sit for 2-3 minutes, then squeeze over the lemon juice and arrange the wedges on top. Scatter with parsley before serving.",

Put the spinach in a large colander and pour over a kettle of boiling water to wilt it (you may need to do this in batches). When cool enough to handle squeeze out the excess water. Roughly chop the spinach and mix in a large bowl with 100g Parmesan and ricotta. Season well with salt, pepper and the nutmeg. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Using a piping bag or plastic food bag with the corner snipped off, squeeze the filling into the cannelloni tubes. Lay the tubes, side by side, on top of the tomato sauce and spoon over the mascarpone sauce. Top with Parmesan and mozzarella. You can now freeze the cannelloni, uncooked, or you can cook it first and then freeze. Bake for 30-35 minutes until golden and bubbling. Remove from oven and let stand for 5 minutes before serving.",

Gently heat until sugar dissolves \u2013 stir a few times. Bring to a boil for 1 min, then tip in the fruit (not strawberries). Cook for 3 minutes over a low heat, stirring 2-3 times. The fruit will be softened, mostly intact and surrounded by dark red juice. Put a sieve over a bowl and tip in the fruit and juice. Line the bowl with cling film and prepare the bread: Line the 1.25-litre basin with cling film as this will help you to turn out the pudding. Overlap two pieces of cling film in the middle of the bowl as it\u2019s easier than trying to get one sheet to stick to all of the curves. Let the edges overhang by about 15cm. Cut the crusts off the bread. Cut 4 pieces of bread in half, a little on an angle, to give 2 lopsided rectangles per piece. Cut 2 slices into 4 triangles each and leave the final piece whole. Build the pud: Dip the whole piece of bread into the juice for a few secs just to coat. Push this into the bottom of the basin. Now dip the wonky rectangular pieces one at a time and press around the basin\u2019s sides so that they fit together neatly, alternately placing wide and narrow ends up. If you can\u2019t quite fit the last piece of bread in it doesn\u2019t matter, just trim into a triangle, dip in juice and slot in. Now spoon in the softened fruit, adding the strawberries here and there as you go. Let flavours mingle then serve: Dip the bread triangles in juice and place on top \u2013 trim off overhang with scissors. Keep leftover juice for later. Bring cling film up and loosely seal. Put a side plate on top and weight down with cans. Chill for 6 hrs or overnight. To serve, open out cling film then put a serving plate upside-down on top and flip over. serve with leftover juice, any extra berries and cream.",

As the ham cooks and softens, you can halve it if you want, so it is all submerged under the liquid. When the ham is tender enough to pull into shreds, it is ready. Lift out the ham, peel off and discard the skin. While it is still hot (wear a clean pair of rubber gloves), shred the meat. Remove bay from the soup and stir in the frozen peas. Simmer for 1 min, then blend until smooth. Add a splash of water if too thick, and return to the pan to heat through if it has cooled, or if you are making ahead.

Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.  Beat the 3 large egg in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated pepper. Set everything aside.  Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).  Squash 2 peeled plump garlic with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.  While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.  Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.  Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don\u2019t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don\u2019t throw the pasta water away yet.  Mix most of the cheese in with the egg, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later. 0 Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the egg and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn\u2019t scramble, and everything is coated. 1 Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tbsp should do it). You don\u2019t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed. 2 Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.",

Stir in beef, sriracha, scallion whites, half the garlic, salt (we used 3/4 tsp kosher salt; 1\u00bd tsp for 4), and pepper. Form into two 1-inch-tall loaves (four loaves for 4). Place on one side of a baking sheet. Toss carrots on empty side of same sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4, spread meatloaves out across whole sheet and add carrots to a second sheet.) Bake for 20 minutes (we'll glaze the meatloaves then). 3. Meanwhile, place potato in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and cook until very tender, 12-15 minutes. Reserve \u00bd cup potato cooking liquid, then drain. While potato cook, in a small bowl, combine soy sauce, garlic powder, 1/4 cup ketchup (\u00bd cup for 4 servings), and 2 tsp sugar (4 tsp for 4). 4. Once meatloaves and carrots have baked 20 minutes, remove from oven. Spoon half the ketchup glaze over meatloaves (save the rest for serving); return to oven until carrots are browned and tender, meatloaves are cooked through, and glaze is tacky, 4-5 minutes more. 5. Meanwhile, melt 2 tbsp butter (4 tbsp for 4 servings) in pot used for potato over medium heat. Add remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add potato and 1/4 tsp wasabi. Mash, adding splashes of reserved potato cooking liquid as necessary until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. (If you like things spicy, stir in more wasabi!) 6. Divide meatloaves, mashed potato, and roasted carrots between plates. Sprinkle with scallion greens and serve with remaining ketchup glaze on the side for dipping.",

        "strDrinkAlternate": null,
        "strCategory": "Dessert",
        "strArea": "British",
        "strInstructions": "Pie Crust: In a food processor, place the flour, salt, and sugar and process until combined. Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles coarse meal (about 15 seconds). Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) water in a slow, steady stream, through the feed tube until the dough just holds together when pinched. If necessary, add more water. Do not process more than 30 seconds. Turn the dough onto your work surface and gather into a ball. Divide the dough in half, flattening each half into a disk, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about one hour before using. This will chill the butter and relax the gluten in the flour.  After the dough has chilled sufficiently, remove one portion of the dough from the fridge and place it on a lightly floured surface. Roll the pastry into a 12 inch (30 cm) circle. (To prevent the pastry from sticking to the counter and to ensure uniform thickness, keep lifting up and turning the pastry a quarter turn as you roll (always roll from the center of the pastry outwards).) Fold the dough in half and gently transfer to a 9 inch (23 cm) pie pan. Brush off any excess flour and trim any overhanging pastry to an edge of \u00bd inch (1\u00bd cm). Refrigerate the pastry, covered with plastic wrap, while you make the filling.  Remove the second round of pastry and roll it into a 13 inch (30 cm) circle. Using a pastry wheel or pizza cutter, cut the pastry into about 3/4 inch (2 cm) strips. Place the strips of pastry on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes.  Make the Strawberry Rhubarb Filling: Place the cut strawberries and rhubarb in a large bowl. In a small bowl mix together the cornstarch, sugar, and ground cinnamon.  Remove the chilled pie crust from the fridge. Sprinkle about 2 tbsp of the sugar mixture over the bottom of the pastry crust. Add the remaining sugar mixture to the strawberries and rhubarb and gently toss to combine. Pour the fruit mixture into the prepared pie shell. Sprinkle the fruit with about 1 tsp of lemon juice and dot with 2 tbsp of butter. Remove the lattice pastry from the refrigerator and, starting at the center with the longest strips and working outwards, place half the strips, spacing about 1 inch (2\u00bd cm) apart, on top of the filling. (Use the shortest pastry strips at the outer edges.) Then, gently fold back, about halfway, every other strip of pastry. Take another strip of pastry and place it perpendicular on top of the first strips of pastry. Unfold the bottom strips of pastry and then fold back the strips that weren't folded back the first time. Lay another strip of pastry perpendicular on top of the filling and then continue with the remaining strips. Trim the edges of the pastry strips, leaving a 1 inch (2\u00bd cm) overhang. Seal the edges of the pastry strips by folding them under the bottom pastry crust and flute the edges of the pastry. Brush the lattice pastry with milk and sprinkle with a little sugar. Cover and place in the refrigerator while you preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) and place the oven rack in the lower third of the oven. Put a baking sheet, lined with aluminum foil, on the oven rack (to catch any spills.) Place the pie plate on the hot baking sheet and bake the pie for about 35 minutes and then, if the edges of the pie are browning too much, cover with a foil ring. Continue to bake the pie for about another 10 minutes or until the crust is a golden brown color and the fruit juices begin to bubble. Remove the pie from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for several hours. Serve at room temperature with softly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for about 3 days. Reheat before serving. This pie can be frozen. Makes one 9 inch (23 cm) pie.",

Dip your hands in the vinegared water, then pat handfuls of rice on top in a \u00bd in thick layer, leaving the furthest edge from you clear. Spread over some Japanese mayonnaise. Use a spoon to spread out a thin layer of mayonnaise down the middle of the rice. Add the filling. Get your child to top the mayonnaise with a line of their favourite fillings (image uses used tuna and cucumber). Roll it up. Lift the edge of the mat over the rice, applying a little pressure to keep everything in a tight roll. Stick down the sides like a stamp. When you get to the edge without any rice, brush with a little water and continue to roll into a tight roll. Wrap in cling film. Remove the mat and roll tightly in cling film before cutting the sushi into thick slices, then unravel the cling film. Layer over some smoked salmon. Line a loaf tin with cling film, then place a thin layer of smoked salmon inside on top of the cling film. Cover with rice and press down. Press about 1\u00bd in of rice over the fish, fold the cling film over and press down as much as you can, using another tin if you have one. Tip it out like a sandcastle. Turn block of sushi onto a chopping board. Cut into smaller pieces, then remove the cling film. Choose your topping. Get a small square of cling film and place a topping on it. Use damp hands to roll walnut-sized balls of rice and place on the topping. Make into tight balls. Bring the corners of the cling film together and tighten into balls by twisting it up, then unwrap and serve.",

Turn the heat down to a simmer and cook, covered, for about 8 minutes until the chicken is cooked. Tip in the potato and beans and let them warm through in the hot coconut milk, then add a lovely citrussy flavour by stirring in the shredded lime leaves (or lime zest).

        "strInstructions": "First make the short crust pastry: measure the flour into a large bowl and rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs (alternatively, this can be done in a food processor). Add about three tbsp of cold water and mix to a firm dough, wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and put a heavy baking tray in the oven to heat up. Grease a deep 18cm/7in loose-bottomed fluted flan tin with butter. Remove about 150g/5\u00bdoz of pastry from the main ball and set aside for the lattice top. Roll the rest of the pastry out thinly on a lightly floured work surface and line the prepared flan tin with the pastry. Prick the base with a fork, to stop the base rising up during baking. Place the reserved pastry for the lattice top on cling film and roll out thinly. Egg wash the pastry and set aside to chill in the fridge (the cling film makes it easier to move about). Do not cut into strips at this stage. Do not egg wash the strips once they are on the tart as it will drip into the treacle mixture. To make the filling, heat the syrup gently in a large pan but do not boil. Once melted, add the breadcrumbs, lemon juice and zest to the syrup. (You can add less lemon if you would prefer less citrus taste.) If the mixture looks runny, add a few more breadcrumbs. Pour the syrup mixture into the lined tin and level the surface. Remove the reserved pastry from the fridge and cut into long strips, 1cm/\u00bdin wide. Make sure they are all longer than the edges of the tart tin. Egg wash the edge of the pastry in the tin, and start to make the woven laying lattice pattern over the mixture, leave the strips hanging over the edge of the tin. Once the lattice is in place, use the tin edge to cut off the strips by pressing down with your hands, creating a neat finish. Bake on the pre-heated baking tray in the hot oven for about 10 minutes until the pastry has started to colour, and then reduce the oven temperature to 180C/350F/Gas 4. If at this stage the lattice seems to be getting too dark brown, cover the tart with tin foil. Bake for a further 25-30 minutes until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling set. Remove the tart from the oven and leave to firm up in the tin. Serve warm or cold.",

Lightly prick all over with a fork, wrap in cling film on a baking sheet and freeze while preparing the apples. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Peel, quarter and core the apples. Put the sugar in a flameproof 20cm ceramic Tatin dish or a 20cm ovenproof heavy-based frying pan and place over a medium-high heat. Cook the sugar for 5-7 minutes to a dark amber caramel syrup that\u2019s starting to smoke, then turn off the heat and stir in the 60g diced butter. To assemble the Tarte Tatin, arrange the apple quarters very tightly in a circle around the edge of the dish first, rounded-side down, then fill in the middle in a similar fashion. Gently press with your hands to ensure there are no gaps. Brush the fruit with the melted butter. Bake in the oven for 30 minutes, then remove and place the disc of frozen puff pastry on top \u2013 it will quickly defrost. Tuck the edges down the inside of the dish and, with a knife, prick a few holes in the pastry to allow steam to escape. Bake for a further 40-45 minutes until the pastry is golden brown and crisp. Allow to cool to room temperature for 1 hr before running a knife around the edge of the dish and inverting it onto a large serving plate that is deep enough to contain the juices. Serve with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or vanilla ice cream.",

        "strInstructions": "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6 and butter 4 small (about 200ml) ramekins. Sprinkle the Parmesan into the ramekins, turning until all sides are covered. Place the milk and bay leaves in a large saucepan over a gentle heat and bring to the boil. Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 15 minutes. Discard the bay leaves, add the butter and flour, and return to a low heat. Very gently simmer, stirring continuously with a balloon whisk, for about 6 minutes until you get a smooth, thick white sauce. Make sure that you get right into the corners of the pan to stop the sauce from catching or becoming lumpy. Once thickened, transfer the sauce to a large bowl and stir in the mustard powder, cayenne pepper, Gruy\u00e8re and egg yolks until fully combined. In a spotlessly clean bowl and with a clean whisk, beat the egg whites just until peaks begin to form. Carefully fold the egg whites into the cheese sauce in three stages making sure you fold, rather than stir, to keep the egg whites light and airy. Fill the prepared ramekins with the souffl\u00e9 mix. Top each souffl\u00e9 with a slice of goat\u2019s cheese, then place on a baking tray. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until springy and well risen but cooked through. Leave to cool, then run a knife around the edge of each dish and remove the souffl\u00e9s. If preparing in advance, place souffl\u00e9s upside down (for neat presentation), on a tray. Cover tray in cling film. Chill for a few days or freeze for up to 1 month. When ready to re-bake, heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Place the upside-down souffl\u00e9s in a shallow baking dish, top with the remaining goat\u2019s cheese slices and pour over the cream (this stops them from drying out when baked for the second time). Cook for 8-10 minutes until golden. Serve immediately alongside some simply dressed salad.",

        "strInstructions": "Heat 2 tsp of the oil in a large saucepan and cook the spring onion over a low heat for 3 minutes or until beginning to soften. Add the spinach, cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook for a further 2\u20133 minutes or until tender and wilted, stirring once or twice. Tip the mixture into a sieve or colander and leave to drain and cool. Using a saucer as a guide, cut out 24 rounds about 12\u00bd cm (5 in) in diameter from the filo pastry, cutting 6 rounds from each sheet. Stack the filo rounds in a pile, then cover with cling film to prevent them from drying out. When the spinach mixture is cool, squeeze out as much excess liquid as possible, then transfer to a bowl. Add the tuna, egg, hot pepper sauce, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well. Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0F, gas mark 6). Take one filo round and very lightly brush with some of the remaining oil. Top with a second round and brush with a little oil, then place a third round on top and brush with oil. Place a heaped tbsp of the filling in the middle of the round, then fold the pastry over to make a half-moon shape. Fold in the edges, twisting them to seal, and place on a non-stick baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pastry and filling to make 8 briks in all. Lightly brush the briks with the remaining oil. Bake for 12\u201315 minutes or until the pastry is crisp and golden brown. Meanwhile, combine the tomato and cucumber in a bowl and sprinkle with the lemon juice and seasoning to taste. Serve the briks hot with this salad and the chutney.",

In a large frying or saute\u0301 pan, add enough oil to come 2cm up the side of the pan. Heat the oil to 180C \u2013 if you don\u2019t have a thermometer, drop a bit of panko into the oil and if it sinks a little then starts to fry, the oil is ready. Add two pork chops and cook for 1 min 30 secs on each side, then remove and leave to rest on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Repeat with the remaining pork chops.  While the pork is resting, make the sauce by whisking the ingredients together, adding a splash of water if it\u2019s particularly thick. Slice the tonkatsu and serve drizzled with the sauce.",
