Melt the butter in a small pan, then add the biscuit crumbs and stir until coated with butter. Tip into the tart tin and, using the back of a spoon, press over the base and sides of the tin to give an even layer. Chill in the fridge while you make the filling. Cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy (Note: This can be done in a food processor if you have one). Process for 2-3 minutes. Mix in the egg, then add the ground almonds and almond extract and blend until well combined. Peel the apples, and cut thin slices of apple. Do this at the last minute to prevent the apple going brown. Arrange the slices over the biscuit base. Spread the frangipane filling evenly on top. Level the surface and sprinkle with the flaked almonds. Bake until golden-brown and set. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for 15 minutes. Remove the sides of the tin. An easy way to do this is to stand the tin on a can of beans and push down gently on the edges of the tin. Transfer the tart, with the tin base attached, to a serving plate. Serve warm with cream, crème fraîche or ice cream.",

Add the clove, cardamom, tamarind pulp, coconut milk, water, sugar and salt. Turn the heat up and bring the mixture to boil. Turn the heat to medium low and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir occasionally, it will reduce slightly. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Don't worry if it's slightly bitter, bitterness will go away when roasting. When the marinade sauce has cooled, pour everything over the chicken and marinate overnight. Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Remove the chicken from the marinade. Spoon the marinade onto a greased (or aluminum lined) baking sheet. Lay the chicken on top of the sauce (make sure the chicken covers the sauce and the sauce isn't exposed or it'll burn) and spread the remaining marinade on the chicken. Roast until internal temp of the thickest part of chicken is at least 175\u00b0F (80\u00b0C). Let chicken rest for 5 minutes. Brush the chicken with some of the oil. Serve chicken with the sauce over steamed rice.",

Season the beef and sear in the hot pan for 30 seconds only on each side (Note: You don't want to cook it at this stage, just color it). Remove the beef from the pan and leave to cool, then brush all over with the mustard. Lay a sheet of cling film on a work surface and arrange the Parma ham slices on it, in slightly overlapping rows. With a palette knife, spread the mushroom paste over the ham, then place the seared beef fillet in the middle. Keeping a tight hold of the cling film from the edge, neatly roll the Parma ham and mushrooms around the beef to form a tight barrel shape. Twist the ends of the cling film to secure. Chill for 10 minutes to allow the beef to set and keep its shape. Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface to a large rectangle, the thickness of a coin. Remove the cling film from the beef, then lay in the center. Brush the surrounding pastry with egg yolk. Fold the ends over, the wrap the pastry around the beef, cutting off any excess. Turn over, so the seam is underneath, and place on a baking sheet. Brush over all the pastry with egg and chill to let the pastry rest. Heat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).

Roast the aubergine until its completely cooked and tender. With a knife check the doneness. The knife should slid easily in aubergines without any resistance. Remove the baingan and immerse in a bowl of water till it cools down. Heat a small piece of natural charcoal on a flame till it becomes smoking hot and red. Make small cuts on the baingan with a knife. Place the red hot charcoal in the same plate where the roasted aubergine is kept. Add a few drops of oil on the charcoal until it begins to smoke. As soon as smoke begins to release from the charcoal, cover the entire plate tightly with a large bowl. Allow the charcoal smoke to get infused for 2 minutes. Peel the skin from the roasted and smoked eggplant. Chop the cooked eggplant finely or you can even mash it. In a kadai or pan, heat oil. Then add finely onion and garlic. Saute the onion till translucent. Add chopped green chillies and saute for a minute. Add the tomato and mix it well. Saute the tomato till the oil starts separating from the mixture.

        "strInstructions": "On one side of the brisket there should be a layer of fat, which you want, if there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them. Using a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 00be-inch (2 cm) apart. Slice through the fat, not the beef. Repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern. Salt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature until satisfied. Pat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat. Cook for 5-8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned. Turn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side. Saute the onion and garlic. When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside. There should be a couple tbsp of fat rendered in the pot, if not, add some olive oil. Add the onion and increase the heat to high. Sprinkle a little salt on the onion. Saute, stirring often, until the onion are lightly browned, 5-8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook a minute longer. Preaheat oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). Return brisket to pot, add herbs, stock, bring to simmer, cover, cook in oven. Use kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme. Move the onion and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside. Add the beef stock and the tied-up herbs. Bring the stock to a boil on the stovetop. Cover the pot, place the pot in the oven and cook for 3 hours. Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly. After 3 hours, add the carrots. Cover the pot and cook until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender. When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board. Cover it with foil. Pull out and discard the herbs. To make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onion, set aside and cover them with foil. Pour the ingredients that are remaining into the pot into a blender, and purée until smooth. Add 1 tbsp of mustard to the mix. Put into a small pot and keep warm. Slice the meat across the grain in slices (Note: cutting this way further tenderizes the meat). Serve with the onion, carrots and gravy.",

        "strInstructions": "Season the beef cubes with salt and pepper. Heat a tbsp of oil in the frying pan and fry the meat over a high heat. Do this in three batches so that you don't overcrowd the pan, transferring the meat to a large flameproof casserole dish once it is browned all over. Add extra oil if the pan seems dry. In the same pan, add another tbsp of oil and cook the shallots for 4-5 minutes, then add the garlic and fry for 30 seconds. Add the bacon and fry until slightly browned. Transfer the onion and bacon mixture to the casserole dish and add the herbs. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Pour the stout into the frying pan and bring to the boil, stirring to lift any stuck-on browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Pour the stout over the beef in the casserole dish and add the stock. Cover the casserole and place it in the oven until the beef is tender and the sauce is reduced. Skim off any surface fat, taste and add salt and pepper if necessary, then stir in the cornflour paste. Put the casserole dish on the hob and simmer for 1-2 minutes, stirring, until thickened. Leave to cool. Increase the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). To make the pastry, put the flour and salt in a very large bowl. Grate the butter and stir it into the flour in three batches. Gradually add 325ml of cold water, and stir until the mixture just comes together. Knead the pastry lightly into a ball on a lightly floured surface and set aside 250g for the pie lid. Roll the rest of the pastry out until it is about 00be of an inch (2cm)larger than the dish you're using. Line the dish with the pastry then pile in the filling, tucking the oysters in as well. Brush the edge of the pastry with beaten egg. Roll the remaining pastry until slightly larger than your dish and gently lift over the filling, pressing the edges firmly to seal, then trim with a sharp knife. Brush with beaten egg to glaze. Put the dish on a baking tray and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling is bubbling.",

        "strInstructions": "For the biscuits, preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) and line 2 large baking trays with baking parchment. Scatter the nuts over a baking tray and roast in the oven until golden-brown. Watch them carefully so that they don't have a chance to burn. Remove from the oven, tip onto a board and leave to cool. Put the butter and sugar in a large bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until light and creamy. Roughly chop the cooled nuts and add to the creamed butter and sugar, along with the lemon zest, flour and baking powder. Stir well until the mixture comes together and forms a ball. Divide the biscuit dough into even pieces and roll into small balls. Place the balls on the prepared baking trays, spaced well apart to allow for spreading. Press the biscuits to flatten to around \u00bd inches (1 cm) thick. Bake the biscuits, one tray at a time until very pale golden-brown. Leave to cool on the trays. They will be very soft when you take them out of the oven, but will crisp as they cool. Store in an airtight tin and eat within five days. For the fool, rinse the blackberries in a colander to wash away any dust or dirt. Put the blackberries in a non-stick saucepan and sprinkle over the caster sugar. Stir in the lemon juice and heat gently for 2 minutes, or until the blackberries begin to soften and release their juices. Remove and reserve 12 blackberries for decoration and continue cooking the rest. Simmer the blackberries very gently for 15 minutes, stirring regularly until very soft and squidgy. Remove from the heat and press the berries and juice through a sieve over a bowl, using the bottom of a ladle to help you extract as much of the purée as possible. Leave the purée to cool and discard the seeds. You should end up with around 325ml of purée. Put the cream and yoghurt in a large bowl and whip with an electric whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl. When the purée is completely cold, adjust the sweetness to taste by adding more sugar if needed. Pour it into the bowl with the whipped cream and yoghurt and stir just once or twice until very lightly combined. Spoon the blackberry fool into individual wide, glass dishes or one large, single bowl. It should look quite marbled. Scatter a few tiny mint leaves on top and decorate with the reserved blackberries. Sprinkle with a little sugar if you like and serve with the hazelnut biscuits.",

To make the almond sponge, put the butter, sugar, flour, ground almonds, baking powder, egg, vanilla and almond extract in a large bowl. Beat with an electric whisk until the mix comes together smoothly. Scrape into the tin, spreading to the corners, and bake for 25-30 minutes (Note: When you poke in a skewer, it should come out clean). Cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling while you make the second sponge. For the pink sponge, line the tin like previously before. Mix all the ingredients together like previouly done before, but don't add the almond extract. Fold in some pink food coloring. Scrape it all into the tin and bake as before. Cool. To assemble, heat the jam in a small pan until runny, then sieve. Barely trim 2 opposite edges from the almond sponge, then well trim a third edge. Roughly measure the height of the sponge, then cutting from the well-trimmed edge, use a ruler to help you cut 4 slices each the same width as the sponge height. Discard or nibble leftover sponge. Repeat with pink cake. Take 2 x almond slices and 2 x pink slices and trim so they are all the same length. Roll out one marzipan block on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar to just over 8 inchec (20 cm) wide, then keep rolling lengthways until the marzipan is roughly \u00bc of an inch (2 cm) thick. Brush with apricot jam, then lay a pink and an almond slice side by side at one end of the marzipan, brushing jam in between to stick sponges, and leaving 1\u00bd inches (4 cm) clear marzipan at the end. Brush more jam on top of the sponges, then sandwich remaining 2 slices on top, alternating colors to give a checkerboard effect. Trim the marzipan to the length of the cakes. Carefully lift up the marzipan and smooth over the cake with your hands, but leave a small marzipan fold along the bottom edge before you stick it to the first side. Trim opposite side to match size of fold, then crimp edges using fingers and thumb. Assemble second Battenberg and keep in an airtight box or well wrapped in cling film for up to 3 days. Can be frozen for up to a month.",

        "strArea": "French",
        "strInstructions": "Heat a large casserole pan and add 1 tbsp goose fat. Season the beef and fry until golden brown, about 3-5 minutes, then turn over and fry the other side until the meat is browned all over, adding more fat if necessary. Do this in 2-3 batches, transferring the meat to a colander set over a bowl when browned. In the same pan, fry the bacon, shallots or pearl onion, mushrooms, garlic and bouquet garni until lightly browned. Mix in the tomato purée and cook for a few minutes, stirring into the mixture. This enriches the bourguignon and makes a great base for the stew. Then return the beef and any drained juices to the pan and stir through. Pour over the wine and about 100ml water so the meat bobs up from the liquid, but isn't completely covered. Bring to the boil and use a spoon to scrape the caramelised cooking juices from the bottom of the pan. Heat oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). Tear off a square of foil slightly larger than the casserole, arrange it in the pan so it covers the top of the stew and trim away any excess foil. Cook for 3 hours (Note: If the sauce looks watery, remove the beef and veg with a slotted spoon, and set aside). Cook the sauce over a high heat for a few minutes until the sauce has thickened a little, then return the beef and vegetables to the pan. To make the celeriac mash, peel the celeriac and cut into cubes. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan. Tip in the celeriac and fry until it turns golden. Season well with salt and pepper. Stir in the rosemary, thyme, bay and cardamom pods, then pour over 200ml water or enough to nearly cover the celeriac. Turn the heat to low, partially cover the pan and leave to simmer for 25-30 minutes, or until most of the water has evaporated. Drain away any remaining water, then remove the herb sprigs, bay and cardamom pods. Lightly crush with a potato masher, then finish with a glug of olive oil and season to taste. Spoon the beef bourguignon into serving bowls and place a large spoonful of the celeriac mash on top. Garnish with one of the bay leaves, if you like.",

Stir and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. Mix flour and coconut milk and add to stew, stirring constantly. Turn heat down to minimum and cook until tender.",

Wash the potato and cut medium dice into square pieces. To prevent any browning, place the already cut potato in a bowl filled with water. In the meantime, heat 1-2 tbsp of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Tilt the skillet so the oil spreads evenly. Once the oil is hot, drain the potato and add to the skillet. Season with salt, pepper, and Old Bay as needed. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring the potato often, until brown. If needed, add a tbsp more of oil. Chop up the bacon and add to the potato. The bacon will start to render and the fat will begin to further cook the potato. The bacon will take 5-6 minutes to crisp. Once the bacon is cooked, reduce the heat to medium-low, add the minced garlic and toss. Season once more. Add dried or fresh parsley. Control heat as needed. Let the garlic cook until fragrant. Just before serving, drizzle over the maple syrup and toss. Let that cook another minute, giving the potato a caramelized effect. Serve in a warm bowl with a sunny side up egg.",

Cut the other 2 into large chunks, then boil until tender. Meanwhile, squeeze as much of the liquid from the grated potato as you can using a clean tea towel. Mash the boiled potato, then mix with the grated potato, spring onion and flour. Whisk the egg white in a large bowl until it holds soft peaks. Fold in the buttermilk, then add the bicarbonate of soda. Fold into the potato mix. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, then add 1 tbsp butter and some of the oil. Drop 3-4 spoonfuls of the potato mixture into the pan, then gently cook on each side until golden and crusty. Keep warm on a plate in the oven while you cook the next batch, adding more butter and oil to the pan before you do so. You will get 16 crumpet-size boxty from the mix. Can be made the day ahead, drained on kitchen paper, then reheated in a low oven for 20 minutes. Heat the grill to medium and put the tomato in a heavy-based pan. Add a good knob of butter and a little oil, then fry for about until softened. Grill the bacon, then pile onto a plate and keep warm. Stack up the boxty, bacon and egg, and serve the tomato on the side.",

Season the boiling water with a few generous pinches of kosher salt. Add the pasta and give it a stir. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Reserve \u00bd cup of pasta water before draining the pasta. Remove the chicken from the pan and transfer it to a cutting board, allow it to rest. Turn the heat down to medium and add the remaining 1 tbsp of butter and olive oil to the same pan you used to cook the chicken. Add the veggies (minus the garlic) and red pepper flakes to the pan and stir to coat with the oil and butter (Note: refrain from seasoning with salt until the veggies are finished browning). Cook, stirring often, until the veggies are tender. Add the garlic and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to the pan and cook for 1 minute. Deglaze the pan with the white wine. Continue to cook until the wine has reduced by half. Stir in the milk, heavy cream, and reserved pasta water. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil and allow to simmer and reduce for 2-3 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the parmesan and cooked pasta. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with parmesan and parsley, if desired.",

Stir in the onion, thyme and bay and cook everything gently until the onion is soft and golden. Scatter over the flour and stir in to make a sandy paste, cook for 2 minutes more, then gradually stir in the clam stock then the milk and the cream. Throw in the potato, bring everything to a simmer and leave to bubble away gently until the potato are cooked. Use a fork to crush a few of the potato chunks against the side of the pan to help thicken. Try to maintain some defined chunks though. Stir through the clam meat and the few clam shells, if you've gone down that route, and simmer for a minute to reheat. Season with plenty of pepper and a little salt, if needed, then stir through the parsley just before ladling into bowls or hollowed-out crusty rolls.",

Put the roux over a low heat and stir continuously for 2 minutes to cook the flour and stop the sauce from having a floury taste. Take the roux off the heat. Slowly add the fresh stock, if using, or pour in 500ml water if you've used a stock cube, stirring all the time. Once all the liquid has been added, season with pepper, a pinch of nutmeg and mustard powder. Put the saucepan back onto a medium heat and slowly bring it to the boil, stirring all the time. Once the sauce has thickened, place on a very low heat. Add the cooked chicken and vegetables to the sauce and stir well. Grease a medium-size ovenproof pie dish with a little butter and pour in the chicken and mushroom filling. Carefully lay the potato on top of the hot-pot filling, overlapping them slightly, almost like a pie top. Brush the potato with a little melted butter and cook in the oven for about 35 minutes. The hot-pot is ready once the potato are cooked and golden brown.",

Drizzle 2-3 tsp cold water into the funnel while the blade is running, the mixture should start to clump together. Tip onto a work surface and bring together, kneading briefly into a ball. Pat into a disc, wrap in cling film, and chill for at least 20 minutes. Heat oven to 400\u00b0F (200 \u00b0C). Remove the pastry from the fridge and leave at room temperature unitl it softens. Flour the work surface, then unwrap the pastry and roll to a circle the thickness of a coin. Use the pastry to line a deep round fluted tin. Press the pastry into the corners and up the sides, making sure there are no gaps. Leave \u00bd an inch (1 cm) pastry overhanging. Line with baking parchment (scrunch it up first to make it more pliable) and fill with baking beans. Bake until the sides are set, then remove the parchment and beans and return to oven until golden brown. Trim the pastry so its flush with the top of the tin, a small serrated knife is best for this. If there are any cracks, patch them up with the pastry scraps. Meanwhile, weigh the butter, syrup and sugars into a pan, and add \u00bc tsp salt. Heat until the butter has melted and the sugar dissolved, stirring until smooth. Remove from the heat and cool for 10 minutes. Reduce oven to 320\u00b0F (160\u00b0C). Beat the egg in a bowl. Add the syrup mixture, vanilla and pecans, and mix until well combined. Pour half the mixture into the tart case, scatter over half the chocolate chips, then cover with the remaining filling and chocolate chips. Bake on the middle shelf until set. Remove from the oven and leave to cool, then chill for at least 2 hours before serving.",

Stir in the leeks and fry gently for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally until just softened. Add the garlic and cook for a further minute. Add the remaining butter and stir in the flour as soon as the butter has melted. Cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Slowly pour the milk into the pan, just a little at a time, stirring well between each adding. Gradually add 250ml of the reserved stock and the wine, if using, stirring until the sauce is smooth and thickened slightly. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 3 minutes. Season the mixture, to taste, with salt and freshly ground pepper. Remove from the heat and stir in the cream. Pour into a large bowl and cover the surface of the sauce with cling film to prevent a skin forming. Set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).

Roll out the reserved pastry for the lid. Cover the pie with the pastry lid and press the edges together firmly to seal. Trim any excess pastry. Make a small hole in the center of the pie with the tip of a knife. Glaze the top of the pie with beaten egg. Bake on the preheated tray in the center of the oven until the pie is golden-brown all over and the filling is hot.",

Meanwhile, warm the milk and butter in a saucepan until the butter melts and the mixture is lukewarm. Add the milk mixture and egg to the flour mixture and stir until the contents of the bowl come together as a soft dough (Note: You may need to add a little extra flour.) Tip the dough onto a generously floured work surface. Knead for five minutes, adding more flour if necessary, until the dough is smooth and elastic and no longer feels sticky. Lightly oil a bowl with a little of the vegetable oil. Place the dough into the bowl and turn until it is covered in the oil. Cover the bowl with cling film and set aside in a warm place for 1 hour, or until the dough has doubled in size. Lightly grease a baking tray. For the filling, knock the dough back to its original size and turn out onto a lightly floured work surface. Roll the dough out into a rectangle \u00bc of an inch (0\u00bdcm) thick. Brush all over with the melted butter, then sprinkle over the brown sugar, cinnamon and dried fruit. Roll the dough up into a tight cylinder , cut ten 1\u00bd inch (4cm) slices and place them onto a lightly greased baking sheet, leaving a little space between each slice. Cover with a tea towel and set aside to rise for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Bake the buns in the oven until risen and golden-brown. Meanwhile, for the glaze, heat the milk and sugar in a saucepan until boiling. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2-3 minutes. Remove the buns from the oven and brush with the glaze, then set aside to cool on a wire rack.",

Stir together, then heat gently to dissolve the sugar. Turn up the heat and boil until reduced and syrupy. Strain into a small, sterilised jam jar and leave to cool completely. Keep in the fridge for up to 3 hours. Take the pastry out of the fridge and leave at room temperature for 10 minutes, then unroll. Heat the grill to high and heat the oven to 360\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Cut out circles of pastry, using a plate as a guide, and place on a non-stick baking sheet. Sprinkle each circle with 1 tbsp sugar and grill for 5 minutes to caramelise, watching carefully so that the sugar doesn't burn. Remove from the grill. Can be done a few hours ahead, and left, covered, out of the fridge. Peel, quarter and core the apples, cut into 2mm-thin slices and arrange on top of the pastry. Sprinkle over the remaining sugar and pop in the oven until the pastry is cooked through and golden, and the apples are softened. Remove and allow to cool slightly. Warm 3 tbsp of the red wine jelly in a small pan over a low heat with 1 tsp water to make it a little more runny, then brush over the top of the tarts. Tip the créme fraîche into a bowl, sift over the icing sugar and cardamom, and mix together. Carefully lift the warm tarts onto serving plates and serve with the cardamom créme fraîche.",

If you only have a regular-sized, 12-hole tart tin you will be able to make a few more slightly shallower tarts. Beat the egg in a large bowl and combine with the rest of the ingredients except the walnuts. Tip this mixture into a pan and stir continuously until the butter melts, and the mixture bubbles and starts to thicken. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Don't overcook, and be sure to stir all the time as the mixture can easily burn. Remove from the heat and stir in the nuts. Spoon the filling into the unbaked tart shells so it's level with the pastry. Bake until set and pale golden. Leave in the tin to cool for a few minutes before lifting out on to a wire rack.

Add the rice, stirring to ensure it is well coated in the oil. Stir in the tomato paste, paprika, bay leaves and chopped thyme. Pour in the stock and wine.

Proceed to slicing the onion, mincing the garlic and dicing the tomato. Set aside. Remove kale from water, cut in chunks. Place bacon on saucepan and cook until crispy. Then add onion, garlic, thyme, stir for about a minute or more. Add tomato, scotch bonnet pepper, smoked paprika. Sauté for about 2-3 more minutes. Finally add vegetable, salt, mix well, and steamed for about until leaves are tender. Add a tiny bit of water as needed. Adjust seasonings and turn off the heat. Using a sharp knife cut both ends off the plantain. This will make it easy to grab the skin of the plantains. Slit a shallow line down the long seam of the plantain; peel only as deep as the peel. Remove plantain peel by pulling it back. Slice the plantain into medium size lengthwise slices and set aside. Coat a large frying pan with cooking oil spray. Spray the tops of the plantains with a generous layer of oil spray and sprinkle with salt and freshly ground pepper. Let the plantains fry on medium heat, shaking the frying pan to redistribute them every few minutes. As the plantains brown, continue to add more cooking oil spray, salt and pepper until they have reached the desired color and texture. Remove and serve with kale",

Pour the wine into a saucepan that will snugly fit the duck legs in a single layer. Brush the salt off the duck legs and place them, skin-side down, in the wine. Cover the pan with a lid and place over a medium heat. As soon as the wine starts to bubble, turn the heat down to the lowest setting and cook for 2 hours, checking occasionally that the liquid is just barely simmering. After 2 hours, the duck legs should be submerged in their own fat and the meat should feel incredibly tender when prodded. Leave to cool. The duck legs are now cooked and can be eaten immediately. Serve with the reheated gravy, a crisp salad and some crisp golden ptoatoes.",

Working in batches and adding more oil if needed, cook eggplant in the same pot until lightly browned on either side. Transfer to a plate with pork. Pour 1 cup of water into the pot and scrape up browned bits from the bottom with a wooden spoon. Add remaining garlic, 3 tbsp coconut vinegar or unseasoned rice vinegar, 2 tbsp soy sauce, 2 bay leaves, tsp freshly ground pepper, and remaining sugar.

Meanwhile put the milk in a large sautée pan, add the fish and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat, cover and stand for 3 minutes. Remove the fish (reserving the milk) and pat dry with paper towel, then gently flake into an ovenproof dish, discarding the skin and any bones. Heat the remaining oil in a pan, stir in the flour and cook for 30 seconds. Gradually stir in 250ml of the reserved milk (Note: Discard the rest). Grate in nutmeg, season, then bubble until thick. Stir in the cream. Preheat the oven to 380\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Grate the artichokes and add to the dish with the leeks, prawns and herbs. Stir the lemon zest and juice into the sauce, then pour over. Mix gently with. Spoon the mash onto the fish mixture, then use a fork to make peaks, which will crisp and brown as it cooks. Sprinkle over the cheese, then bake until golden and bubbling. Serve with wilted greens.",

Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them with a fork so they break up and mix lightly. With the heat on medium-hot, drop one knob of butter into the pan. It should bubble and sizzle. Season the eggs with the Parmesan and a little salt and pepper, and pour into the pan. Let the egg bubble slightly for a couple of seconds, then take a fork or spatula and gently draw the mixture in from the sides of the pan a few times, so it gathers in folds in the center. Leave for a few seconds, then stir again to lightly combine uncooked eggs with the eggs that are cooked. Leave briefly again, and when partly cooked, stir a bit faster, stopping while there's some barely cooked egg left. With the pan flat on the heat, shake it back and forth a few times to settle the mixture. It should slide easily in the pan and look soft and moist on top. A quick burst of heat will brown the underside. Grip the handle underneath. Tilt the pan down away from you and let the omelette fall to the edge. Fold the side nearest to you over by a third with your fork, and keep it rolling over, so the omelette tips onto a plate or fold it in half. For a neat finish, cover the omelette with a piece of kitchen paper and plump it up a bit with your fingers. Rub the other knob of butter over to glaze. Serve immediately.",

If you feel the dough is still not coming together or too dry, gradually add the remaining water until you get a dough that is very elastic so that when you pull it and it won't be torn. Let the dough rest for just 10 minutes then divide the dough into balls sized to your preference. Warm up the butter/ghee or oil you are using and pour into a deep bowl. Immerse the dough balls into the warm butter. Let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 550\u00b0F (290\u00b0C). Stretch the first ball with your hands on a clean countertop. Stretch it as thin as you can, (Note: the goal here is to see your countertop through the dough). Fold the dough over itself to form a square brushing in between folds with the butter mixture. Set aside and start making the next ball. Stretch the second one thin as we have done for the first ball. Place the previous one on the middle seam side down. Fold the outer one over brushing with more butter mixture as you fold. Set aside. Keep doing this for the third and fourth balls. Once you have one ready, place on a 10 inch (25 cm) baking/pie dish seam side down and brush the top with more butter. Repeat for the remaining balls. Lightly press the folded feteer to spread it on the baking dish. Place in preheated oven for 10 minutes. When the feteer starts puffing turn on the broiler to brown the top. When it is done add a little butter on top and cover so it won't get dry. Serve.",

Pull the roasting tin out on its shelf, fill 2/3 with boiling water from the kettle, then carefully slide it back in. Heat oven to 360\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Tear off a large sheet of foil and greaseproof paper. Sit the greaseproof on top of the foil and butter it. Tip butter, flour and vanilla seeds into a food processor, pulse until the butter has disappeared. Tip into a mixing bowl. Stir through the suet, pour in the milk and work together with a cutlery knife until you get a sticky dough. You may need a drop more milk, depending on your flour. Tip the dough out onto a floured surface, quickly pat together to smooth, then roll out to a square roughly 10 inch by 10 inch (25 cm x 25 cm). Spread the jam all over, leaving a gap along one edge, then roll up from the opposite edge. Pinch the jam-free edge into the dough where it meets, and pinch the ends roughly, too. Carefully lift onto the greased paper, join-side down (Note: you might find a flat baking sheet helpful for this). Loosely bring up the paper and foil around it, then scrunch together along the edges and ends to seal. The roly-poly will puff quite a bit during cooking so don't wrap it tightly. Lift the parcel directly onto the rack above the tin and cook for 1 hour. Let the pudding sit for 5 minutes before unwrapping, then carefully open the foil and paper, and thickly slice to serve.",

If you're having trouble getting it to blend, just keep turning off the blender, stirring the mixture, and trying again. Taste the jerk mixture for seasoning, it should taste pretty salty. You can now throw in more chillies if it's not spicy enough for you. Make a few slashes in the chicken thighs and pour the marinade over the meat, rubbing it into all the crevices. Cover and leave to marinate overnight in the fridge. If you want to barbecue your chicken, get the coals burning 1 hour or so before you're ready to cook. To get a more authentic jerk experience, add some wood chips to your barbecue, and cook your chicken over slow, indirect heat for 30 minutes. To cook in the oven, heat to 360\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Put the chicken pieces in a roasting tin with the lime halves and cook until tender and cooked through. While the chicken is cooking, prepare the rice & peas. Rinse the rice in plenty of cold water, then tip it into a large saucepan with all the remaining ingredients except the kidney beans. Season with salt, add 300ml cold water and set over a high heat. Once the rice begins to boil, turn it down to a medium heat, cover and cook for 10 minutes. Add the beans to the rice, then cover with a lid. Leave off the heat until all the liquid is absorbed. Squeeze the roasted lime over the chicken and serve with the rice & peas, and some hot sauce if you like it really spicy. Serve.",

Rub shortening into flour until there are small pieces of shortening completely covered with flour. Pour in \u00bd cup of the ice water and mix with your hands to bring the dough together. Keep adding ice water 2 to 3 tbsp at a time until the mixture forms a dough. At this stage, you can cut the dough into 2 large pieces, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes before using it. Alternatively, cut the dough into 10 to 12 equal pieces, place on a platter or baking sheet, cover securely with plastic wrap and let chill for 30 minutes while you make the filling. Add ground beef to a large bowl. Sprinkle in allspice and pepper. Mix together and set aside. Heat oil in a skillet until hot. Add onion and sautée until translucent. Add hot pepper, garlic and thyme and continue to sautée for another minute. Add \u00bc tsp salt. Add seasoned ground beef and toss to mix, breaking up any clumps, and let cook until the meat is no longer pink. Add ketchup and more salt to taste. Pour in 2 cups of water and stir. Bring the mixture to a boil then reduce heat and let simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated and whatever is remaining has reduced to a thick sauce. Fold in green onion. Remove from heat and let cool completely. Beat the egg and water together to make an egg wash. Set aside. Flour the work surface and rolling pin. If you had cut it into 2 large pieces, then take 1 of the large pieces and roll it out into a very large circle. Take a bowl with a wide rim and cut out three circles. Place about 3 heaping tbsp of the filling onto \u00bd of each circle. Dip a finger into the water and moisten the edges of the pastry. Fold over the other half and press to seal. Take a fork and crimp the edges. Cut off any extra to make it look neat and uniform. After forming the patties, place the pans in the refrigerator while you heat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Just before adding the pans with the patties to the oven, brush the patties with egg wash. Bake patties until golden brown. Cool on wire racks. Serve warm.",

They should be only partially cooked and still have a bite to them as they need to finish cooking with the rice). Drain the rice from its soaking water. Combine the partially cooked lentils and the rice in the saucepan over medium-high heat with 1 tbsp cooking oil, salt, pepper, and coriander. Cook while stirring regularly. Add warm water to cover the rice and lentil mixture (Note: you'll probably use about 3 cups of water here). Bring to a boil, the water should reduce a bit. Now cover and cook until all the liquid has been absorbed and both the rice and lentils are well cooked through. Keep covered and undisturbed. While the rice and lentils are cooking, make the pasta according to package instructions by adding the elbow pasta to boiling water with a dash of salt and a little oil. Cook until the pasta is done. Drain. Cover the chickpeas and warm in the microwave briefly before serving. Sprinkle the onion rings with salt, then toss them in the flour to coat. Shake off excess flour. In a large skillet, heat the cooking oil over medium-high heat, cook the onion rings, stirring often, until they turn a nice caramelized brown. Serve.",

        "strInstructions": "Use pickled vine leaves here, preserved in brine, and remove any stalks. Drain the preserved leaves, immerse them in boiling water for 10 minutes and then leave to dry on a tea towel before use. Basmati rice with butter and pine nuts is an ideal accompaniment. Put all the ingredients, apart from the tomato, in a bowl. Cut the tomato in half, coarsely grate into the bowl and discard the skins. Add half a tsp of salt and some pepper, and stir. Leave on the side, or in the fridge, for up to a day. Before using, gently squeeze with your hands and drain away any juices that come out. To make the sauce, heat the oil in a medium pan. Add the ginger and garlic, cook for a minute or 2, taking care not to burn them, then add the tomato, lemon juice and sugar. Season, and simmer for 20 minutes. While the sauce is bubbling away, prepare the vine leaves. Use any torn or broken leaves to line the base of a wide, heavy saucepan. Trim any leaves from the fennel, cut it vertically into slices and spread over the base of the pan to cover completely. Lay a prepared vine leaf on a work surface, veiny side up. Put 2 tsp of filling at the base of the leaf in a \u00be of an inch x \u00bd of an inch (2 cm x 1 cm). Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it tightly from bottom to top, in a cigar shape. Place in the pan, seam down, and repeat with the remaining leaves, placing them tightly next to each other in lines or circles. Pour the sauce over the leaves (Note: if needed, add water just to cover). Place a plate on top, to weigh the leaves down, then cover with a lid. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook on a bare simmer for 1 hour. Most of the liquid should evaporate. Remove from the heat, and leave to cool a little. Serve with a few vine leaves and fennel slices with warm rice. Spoon the braising juices on top and garnish with coriander.",

Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, then tip in the mince and cook, stirring and breaking it up until browned all over. Stir in the tomato puréee and cook for 1 minute, mixing in well with the beef and vegetables. Tip in the tomato. Fill each can half full with water to rinse out any tomato left in the can, and add to the pan. Add the honey and season to taste. Simmer for 20 minutes. Heat oven to 400[0-9]. To assemble the lasagne, ladle a little of the ragu sauce into the bottom of the roasting tin or casserole dish, spreading the sauce all over the base. Place 2 sheets of lasagne on top of the sauce overlapping to make it fit, then repeat with more sauce and another layer of pasta. Repeat with a further 2 layers of sauce and pasta, finishing with a layer of pasta. Put the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche in a bowl and mix with 2 tbsp water to loosen it and make a smooth pourable sauce. Pour this over the top of the pasta, then top with the mozzarella. Sprinkle parmesan over the top and bake until golden and bubbling. Serve scattered with basil.",

Roughly chop the remaining chestnuts. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Fry the shallots with a pinch of salt until softened, then add the garlic, chopped chestnuts and rosemary, and fry for 2 minutes more. Add the wild mushrooms, 2 tbsp oil and some seasoning. Cook until they begin to soften. Drain and roughly chop the dried mushrooms (Note: reserve the soaking liquid), then add those too, along with the soy sauce, and fry for 2 minutes more. Whisk the wine, reserved mushroom liquid and chestnut cream together to create a sauce. Season, then add half to the mushroom mixture in the pan and cook for 1 minute until the sauce becomes glossy. Remove and discard the rosemary sprigs, then set the mixture aside. Heat oven to 360\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and get a large bowl of ice water ready. Drop the lasagne sheets into the boiling water until pliable and a little cooked, then immediately plunge them into the cold water. Using your fingers, carefully separate the sheets and transfer to a clean tea towel. Spread a good spoonful of the sauce on the bottom 2 thirds of each sheet, then, rolling away from yourself, roll up the shorter ends. Cut each roll in half, then position the rolls of pasta cut-side up in a pie dish that you are happy to serve from at the table. If you have any mushroom sauce remaining after you've rolled up all the sheets, simply push it into some of the exposed rolls of pasta. Pour the rest of the sauce over the top of the pasta, then bake until the pasta no longer has any resistance when tested with a skewer. Meanwhile, put the breadcrumbs, the last 2 tbsp olive oil, sage leaves and some seasoning in a bowl, and toss everything together. Scatter the rotolo with the crumbs and sage, then bake until the top is golden and the sage leaves are crispy. Leave to cool for 10 minutes to allow the pasta to absorb the sauce, then drizzle with a little truffle oil. Serve.",

        "strInstructions": "Heat a large frying pan and toast the cumin seeds for a few minutes, then set aside. Heat the oil in the same pan and fry the onion, garlic, chilli, pepper and a good pinch of salt until there is no moisture left. Remove from the heat, stir in the toasted cumin seeds, ground nutmeg and ground coriander. Leave to cool. In a large bowl mix together the minced lamb, white pepper, fresh coriander, and the cooled spiced onion mixture until combined. Set aside, covered, in the fridge. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) and generously grease an 8 inch (20 cm) diameter loose-bottomed or springform round cake tin with lard. To make the pastry, sift the flour and salt in a large bowl and make a well in the center. Put the milk, lard and 90ml of water in a saucepan and heat gently. When the lard has melted, increase the heat and bring to a boil. Pour the boiling liquid into the flour, and use a wooden spoon to combine until cool enough to handle. Bring together into a ball. Dust a work surface with flour and, working quickly, knead the dough briefly (Note: it will be soft and moist). Set aside a third of the pastry and roll the rest out on a well-floured surface. Line the pie dish with the pastry, pressing it right up the sides until it pokes just over the top of the tin. Add the filling into the pastry-lined tin bit by bit. As you reach the top, form a slight peak. Roll out the reserved pastry and top the pie with it. Pinch the edges to seal and trim the excess. Poke a hole in the top of the pie and insert a small tube made from aluminium foil to allow steam to escape. Brush the top of the pie with a little beaten egg yolk, and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes (Note: put a tray on the shelf below to catch any drips). Then reduce the temperature to 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C) and cook for another hour until golden-brown. Leave to cool completely before refrigerating for 2 hours, or overnight. Run a knife around the edge of the pie, remove from the tin. Serve with chutneys, salads or pickles.",

Coat entire brisket with the cure and place in an extra-large resealable plastic bag. Place in the coldest part of the refrigerator and cure for 4 days, flipping brisket twice a day. Remove brisket from bag and wash as much cure off as possible under cold running water. Place brisket in a large container and fill with water and let soak for 2 hours, replacing water every 30 minutes. Remove from water and pat dry with paper towels. To make the rub, mix together pepper, coriander, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, dill weed, mustard, celery seed, and crushed red papper in a small bowl. Coat entire brisket with the rub. Fire up smoker or grill to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C), adding chunks of smoking wood. When wood is ignited and producing smoke, place brisket in, fat side up, and smoke until an instant read thermometer registers 190\u00b0F (90\u00b0C) when inserted into thickest part of the brisket. Transfer brisket to large roasting pan with v-rack. Place roasting pan over 2 burners on stovetop and add water. Bring water to a boil over high heat, reduce heat to medium, cover roasting pan with aluminum foil, and steam brisket until an instant read thermometer registers 180\u00b0F (80\u00b0C) when inserted into thickest part of the meat, adding more hot water as needed. Transfer brisket to cutting board and let cool slightly. Slice and serve, preferrably on rye.",

        "strInstructions": "Heat the oven to 300 degrees. Dredging the shanks: pour the flour into a shallow dish (a pie plate works nicely). Season the veal shanks on all sides with salt and pepper. One at a time, roll the shanks around in the flour coat, and shake and pat the shank to remove any excuses flour. Discard the remaining flour. Browning the shanks: put the oil and 1 tbsp of the butter in a wide Dutch oven or heavy braising pot (6 to 7 quart) and heat over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted and the oil is shimmering, lower the shanks into the pot, flat side down; if the shanks won't fit without touching one another, do this in batches. Brown the shanks, turning once with tongs, until both flat sides are well caramelized, about 5 minutes per side. If the butter-oil mixture starts to burn, lower the heat just a bit. Transfer the shanks to a large platter or tray and set aside. The aromatics: pour off and discard the fat from the pot. Wipe out any burnt bits with a damp paper towel, being careful not to remove any delicious little caramelized bits. Ad the remaining 2 tbsp butter to the pot and melt it over medium heat. When the butter has stopped foaming, add the onion, carrots, celery, and fennel. Season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook the vegetables until they begin to soften but do not brown, about 6 minutes. Stir in the garlic, orange zest, marjoram, and Bay Leaves, and stew for another minute or 2. The braising liquid: add the wine, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Boil, stirring occasionally, to reduce the wine by about half, 5 minutes. Add the stock and tomato, with their juice, and boil again to reduce the liquid to about 1 cup total, about 10 minutes. The braise: Place the shanks in the pot so that they are sitting with the exposed bone facing up, and pour over any juices that accumulated as they sat. Cover with parchment paper, pressing down so the parchment nearly touches the veal and the edges hang over the sides of the pot by about an inch. Cover tightly with the lid, and slide into the lower part of the oven to braise at a gentle simmer. Check the pot after the first 15 minutes, and if the liquid is simmering too aggressively, lower the oven heat by 10 or 15 degrees. Continue braising, turning the shanks and spooning some pan juices over the top after the first 40 minutes, until the meat is completely tender and pulling away from the bone, about 2 hours. The gremolata: While the shanks are braising, stir together the garlic, parsley, and lemon zest in a small bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a cool place (or the refrigerator, if your kitchen is very warm.) The finish: When the veal is fork-tender and falling away from the bone, remove the lid and sprinkle over half of the gremolata. Return the veal to the oven, uncovered, for another 15 minutes to caramelize it some. Using a slotted spatula or spoon, carefully lift the shanks from the braising liquid, doing your best to keep them intact. The shanks will be very tender and threatening to fall into pieces, and the marrow will be wobbly inside the bones, so this can be a bit tricky. But if they do break apart, don't worry, the flavor won't suffer at all. Arrange the shanks on a serving platter or other large plate, without stacking, and cover with foil to keep warm. Finishing the sauce: Set the braising pot on top of the stove and evaluate the sauce: if there is a visible layer of fat floating on the surface, use a large spoon to skim it off and discard it. Taste the sauce for concentration of flavor. If it tastes a bit weak or flat, bring it to a boil over high heat, and boil to reduce the volume and intensify the flavor for 5 to 10 minutes. Taste again for salt and pepper. If the sauce wants more zip, stir in a tsp or 2 of the remaining gremolata. Portioning the veal shanks: if the shanks are reasonably sized, serve one per person. If the shanks are gargantuan or you're dealing with modest appetites, pull apart the larger shanks, separating them at their natural seams, and serve smaller amounts. Be sure to give the marrow bones to whomever prizes them most. Serving: Arrange the veal shanks on warm dinner plates accompanied by the risotto, if serving. Just before carrying the plates to the table, sprinkle on the remaining gremolata and then spoon over a generous amount of sauce \u2013 the contact with the hot liquid will aromatize the gremolata and perk up everyone's appetite with the whiff of garlic and lemon.",

(It's always tastes better full fat though obviously!) to serve 4: use 800g of potato, finely slice and boil in a pan for about 5-8 minutes till firmish, not soft. Finely slice 3 onion and place in an oven dish with 2 tblsp of olive oil and 100ml of chicken stock. Cook till the onion are soft then drain the potato and pour onto the onion. Season and spoon over cream or creme fraiche till all is covered but not swimming. Grate Parmesan over the top then finish under the grill till nicely golden. serve with chicken and bacon, peas and spinach.",

        "strInstructions": "Core the pears, then peel as neatly as possible and halve. If you like, they can be prepared up to a day ahead and kept in the fridge, uncovered, so that they dry out. Tip the sugar, butter, star anise, cardamom and cinnamon into an ovenproof frying pan, about 20cm wide, and place over a high heat until bubbling. Shake the pan and stir the buttery sauce until it separates and the sugar caramelises to a toffee color. Lay the pears in the pan, then cook in the sauce for 10-12 minutes, tossing occasionally, until completely caramelised. Don't worry about them burning \u2013 they won't \u2013 but you want to caramelise them as much as possible. Splash in the brandy and let it flambée, then set the pears aside. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Roll the pastry out to the thickness of a \u00a31 coin. Using a plate slightly larger than the top of the pan, cut out a circle, then press the edges of the circle of pastry to thin them out. When the pears have cooled slightly, arrange them in the pan, cut side up, in a floral shape, with the pears around the edge pointing inwards. Rest the cinnamon stick on the top in the center, with the cardamom pods scattered around. Drape the pastry over the pears, then tuck the edges down the pan sides and under the fruit (see Gordon's guide). Pierce the pastry a few times, then bake for 15 minutes. If a lot of juice bubbles up the side of the pan, pour it off at this stage (see guide). Reduce oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4 and bake for 15 minutes more until the pastry is golden. Leave the tart to stand for 10 minutes, then invert it carefully onto a serving dish.",

Add the roasted peppers to the other bowl of egg with the garlic, chilli, salt and pepper. Heat a little oil in a 20-23cm frying pan, preferably non-stick. Pour the egg with courgette into a measuring jug, then pourabout 1/3 of the mixture into the pan, swirling it to cover the base of the pan. Cook until the egg is set and lightly browned underneath, then cover the pan with a plate and invert the omelette onto it. Slide it back into the pan to cook the other side. Repeat with the remaining mix to make 2 more omelettes, adding a little oil to the pan each time. Stack the omelettes onto a plate. Make three omelettes in the same way with the red pepper mixture, then stack them on a separate plate. Now make the filling. Beat the cheese to soften it, then beat in the milk to make a spreadable consistency. Stir in the herbs, salt and pepper. Line a deep, 20-23cm round cake tin with cling film (use a tin the same size as the frying pan). Select the best red pepper omelette and place in the tin, prettiest side down. Spread with a thin layer of cheese filling, then cover with a courgette omelette. Repeat, alternating the layers, until all the omelettes and filling are in the tin, finishing with an omelette. Flip the cling film over the omelette, then chill for up to 24 hours. To serve, invert the omelette cake onto a serving plate and peel off the cling film. Pile rocket on the top and scatter over the cheese, a drizzle of olive oil and a little freshly ground pepper. Serve cut into wedges.",

Put the onion, rutabaga, and beef through a meat grinder twice if you have one, if not just chop them up as fine as possible. Melt the remaining 4 tbsp butter over medium heat, and add the meat mixture. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until all of the liquid has evaporated and the mixture is thick enough to hold its shape. Remove from heat and let cool, then stir in 1 egg, and season with salt and pepper. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a 13x8\" rectangle (1/8\" thick). Spoon the filling down the center of the rectangle lengthwise, leaving about an inch of space on each end. Lightly brush the long sides with cold water, then fold one of the long sides over the filling and the other side over the top of that. Brush the short ends with cold water and fold them over the top, enclosing the filling. Place pastry seam side down on a baking sheet and brush the top evenly with the remaining scrambled egg. Bake in preheated oven until rich golden brown (30 minutes). Slice pastry diagonally into 1\u00bd\" long pieces and serve as an appetizer or with soup.",

Bash it into an escalope the size of a side-plate with a rolling pin and repeat with the remaining pieces.  Put the wine, paprika, some salt and pepper and the juice of \u00bd a lemon in a bowl and add the pork. Leave to marinate for 20-30 minutes, while you get your barbecue to the stage where the coals are glowing but there are no flames.  To make the chips, fill a basin with cool water and cut the potato into 3cm-thick chips. Soak them in the water for 5 minutes and then change the water. Leave for 5 more minutes. Drain and then pat dry on a towel or with kitchen paper.  Heat the oil in a deep fryer or a deep heavy-based pan with a lid to 130C and lower the chips into the oil (in batches). Blanch for 8-10 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain well. Place on a tray to cool. Reheat the oil to 180C (make sure it's hot or your chips will be soggy) and lower the basket of chips into the oil (again, do this in batches). Leave to cook for 2 minutes and then give them a little shake. Cook for another minute or so until they are well colored and crisp to the touch. Drain well for a few minutes, tip into a bowl and sprinkle with sea salt.  The pork will cook quickly so do it in 2 batches. Take the pieces out of the marinade, rub them with oil, and drop them onto the barbecue (you could also use a chargrill). Cook for 1 minute on each side \u2013 they may flare up as you do so. This should really be enough time as they will keep on cooking. Take them off the barbecue and pile onto a plate. Repeat with the remaining batch.  Serve by piling a plate with chips, drop the pork on top of each pile and pouring the juices from the plate over so the chips take up the flavours. Top with a spoon of mayonnaise and a wedge of lemon.",

        "strInstructions": "Heat a tbsp of oil in a large saute pan for which you have a lid. Add the sausage pieces and fry on a medium-high heat for 10 minutes, stirring regularly, until golden-brown all over. Transfer the sausages to a plate, then add the onion and fennel to the hot pan and fry for 15 minutes, stirring once in a while, until soft and caramelised; if the pan goes a bit dry, add a tsp or so of extra oil. Stir in the paprika, garlic and half the fennel seeds, fry for 2 minutes more, then pour on the wine and boil for 30 seconds, to reduce by half. Add the tomato, sugar, 100ml water, the seared sausage and half a tsp of salt, cover and simmer for 30 minutes; remove the lid after 10 minutes, and cook until the sauce is thick and rich. Remove from the heat, stir through the olives and remaining fennel seeds and set aside until you're ready to serve. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook for 12-14 minutes (or according to the instructions on the packet), until al dente. Meanwhile, reheat the sauce. Drain the pasta, return it to the pot, stir in a tbsp of oil, then divide between the bowls.  Put all the pesto ingredients except the basil in the small bowl of a food processor. Add a tbsp of water and blitz to a rough paste. Add the basil, then blitz until just combined (the pesto has a much better texture if the basil is not overblended). Spoon over the rag\u00f9 and top with a spoonful of pesto. Finish with a sprinkling of chopped fennel fronds, if you have any, and serve at once.",

Combine all nicely and marinate for 35-40 minutes. Grind the mixture until soft and smooth. Add more vinegar if required but ensure the paste has to be thick so add vinegar accordingly. If the masala paste is thin then it would not stick to the fish. Rinse the fish slit from the center and give some incision from the top. You could see the fish below for clarity. Now stuff the paste into the center and into the incision. Coat the entire fish with this paste. Marinate the fish for 30 minutes. Place oil in a shallow pan, once oil is quite hot shallow fry the stuffed mackerels. Fry until golden brown from both sides Serve the recheado mackerels hot with salad, lime wedges, rice and curry. Notes 1. Ensure the masala paste is thick else the result won't be good. 2. If you aren't able to find kashmiri chillies then use bedgi chillies or kashmiri chilli powder. 3. You could use white vinegar or coconut vinegar. 4. Any left over paste could be stored in the fridge for future use. 5. Cinnamon could be avoided as it's a strong spice used generally for meat or chicken.",

Drain the beans; if they're canned, rinse them as well. Add them to the pot along with tomato and their juices and stock, rosemary and thyme. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat so the soup bubbles steadily; cover and cook, stirring once or twice to break up the tomato, until the flavors meld, 15 to 20 minutes. Fish out and discard rosemary and thyme stems, if you like, and stir in kale. Taste and adjust seasoning. Lay bread slices on top of the stew so they cover the top and overlap as little as possible. Scatter red onion slices over the top, drizzle with the remaining 3 tbsp oil and sprinkle with Parmesan. Put the pot in the oven and bake until the bread, onion and cheese are browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. (If your pot fits under the broiler, you can also brown the top there.) Divide the soup and bread among 4 bowls and serve.",

        "strCategory": "Vegetarian",

        "strInstructions": " For the Lentils: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F (225\u00b0C) to prepare for roasting eggplant. Meanwhile, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add carrots, celery, and onion and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add lentils, bay leaves, stock or water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer, cover with the lid partially ajar, and cook until lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. (Top up with water if lentils are at any point not fully submerged.) Remove lid, stir in vinegar, and reduce until lentils are moist but not soupy. Season to taste with salt and pepper, cover, and keep warm until ready to serve. 2. For the Eggplant: While lentils cook, cut each eggplant in half. Score flesh with the tip of a paring knife in a cross-hatch pattern at 1-inch intervals. Transfer to a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, cut side up, and brush each eggplant half with 1 tbsp oil, letting each brushstroke be fully absorbed before brushing with more. Season with salt and pepper. Place a rosemary sprig on top of each one. Transfer to oven and roast until completely tender and well charred, 25 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven and discard rosemary. 3. To Serve: Heat 2 tbsp olive oil and pine nuts in a medium skillet set over medium heat. Cook, tossing nuts frequently, until golden brown and aromatic, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl to halt cooking. Stir half of parsley and rosemary into lentils and transfer to a serving platter. Arrange eggplant halves on top. Spread a few tbsp of tahini sauce over each eggplant half and sprinkle with pine nuts. Sprinkle with remaining parsley and rosemary, drizzle with additional olive oil, and serve.",

        "strInstructions": "Wash and rinse the dried kidney beans.. then cover with water in a deep bowl. Remember as they soak they will expand to at least triple the size they were originally so add a lot of water to the bowl. Soak them overnight or for at least 2 hours to make the cooking step go quicker. I tossed out the water they were soaked in after it did the job. Have your butcher cut the salted pigtail into 2 inch pieces as it will be very difficult to cut with an ordinary kitchen knife. Wash, then place a deep pot with water and bring to a boil. Cook for 20 minutes, then drain + rinse and repeat (boil again in water). The goal is to make the pieces of pig tails tender and to remove most of the salt it was cured in. Time to start the soup. Place everything in the pot (except the flour and potato), then cover with water and place on a high flame to bring to a boil. As it comes to a boil, skim off any scum/froth at the top and discard. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil and allow it to cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes.. basically until the beans are tender and start falling apart. It's now time to add the potato (and Yams etc if you're adding it) as well as the coconut milk and continue cooking for 15 minutes. Now is a good time to start making the basic dough for the spinner dumplings. Mix the flour and water (add a pinch of salt if you want) until you have a soft/smooth dough. allow it to rest for 5 minutes, then pinch of a tbsp at a time and roll between your hands to form a cigarette shape. Add them to the pot, stir well and continue cooking for another 15 minutes on a rolling boil. You'll notice that I didn't add any salt to the pot as the remaining salt from the salted pigtails will be enough to properly season this dish. However you can taste and adjust accordingly. Lets recap the timing part of things so you're not confused. Cook the base of the soup for 1 hour and 15 minute or until tender, then add the potato and cook for 15 minutes, then add the dumplings and cook for a further 15 minutes. Keep in mind that this soup will thicken quite a bit as it cools. While this is not a traditional recipe to any one specific island, versions of this soup (sometimes called stewed peas) can be found throughout the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa. A hearty bowl of this soup will surely give you the sleepies (some may call it ethnic fatigue). You can certainly freeze the leftovers and heat it up another day.",

Sautée the onion for 8\u201310 minutes until softened. Increase the heat to medium and stir in the rice, paprika and saffron. Cook for around 1 minute to start toasting the rice, then add the white wine. Reduce by about half before stirring in 2/3 of the stock. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes without a lid, stirring a couple of times. 3 Stir in the peas, add some seasoning, then gently mix in the roasted veg. Pour over the remaining stock, arrange the lemon wedges on top and cover with a lid or some aluminium foil. Cook for a further 10 minutes. 4 To ensure you get the classic layer of toasted rice at the bottom of the pan, increase the heat to high until you hear a slight crackle. Remove from the heat and sit for 5 minutes before sprinkling over the parsley and serving.",

        "strInstructions": "Stone and chop the dates quite small, put them in a bowl, then pour the boiling water over. Leave for about 30 minutes until cool and well-soaked, then mash a bit with a fork. Stir in the vanilla extract. Butter and flour seven mini pudding tins (each about 200ml/7fl oz) and sit them on a baking sheet. Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. While the dates are soaking, make the puddings. Mix the flour and bicarbonate of soda together and beat the egg in a separate bowl. Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl for a few minutes until slightly creamy (the mixture will be grainy from the sugar). Add the egg a little at a time, beating well between additions. Beat in the black treacle then, using a large metal spoon, gently fold in 1/3 of the flour, then half the milk, being careful not to overbeat. Repeat until all the flour and milk is used. Stir the soaked dates into the pudding batter. The mix may look a little curdled at this point and will be like a soft, thick batter. Spoon it evenly between the tins and bake for 20-25 minutes, until risen and firm. Meanwhile, put the sugar and butter for the sauce in a medium saucepan with half the cream. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, stirring all the time, until the sugar has completely dissolved. Stir in the black treacle, turn up the heat slightly and let the mixture bubble away for 2-3 minutes until it is a rich toffee color, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn't burn. Take the pan off the heat and beat in the rest of the cream. Remove the puddings from the oven. Leave in the tins for a few minutes, then loosen them well from the sides of the tins with a small palette knife before turning them out. You can serve them now with the sauce drizzled over, but they'll be even stickier if left for a day or 2 coated in the sauce. To do this, pour about half the sauce into one or 2 ovenproof serving dishes. Sit the upturned puddings on the sauce, then pour the rest of the sauce over them. Cover with a loose tent of foil so that the sauce doesn't smudge (no need to chill). When ready to serve, heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Warm the puddings through, still covered, for 15-20 minutes or until the sauce is bubbling. Serve them on their own, or with cream or custard.",

If you don't mix it enough it will not set well enough, but don't get impatient and whisk it really quick because that'll make it split! Spread over the biscuit base and leave to set in the fridge overnight. 4) Remove the Cheesecake from the tin carefully and decorate the cheesecake \u2013 I drizzled over some of the spare caramel, and then some Toffee Popcorn and more Pretzels!",

If using vermicelli, put in a bowl and crush to little pieces (about 1cm long) with your hands. Heat the oil in a large frying pan with at least a 3cm lip, or a 40cm paella pan. Add the onion and stir around the pan for 5 minutes until soft. Add the garlic and cook for 1 min more, then tip in the vermicelli and cook for 5 minutes, stirring from time to time, until the vermicelli is toasted brown. Stir in the paprika.

Spread the ingredients out in an even layer, then pour over the hot stock and scatter the tomato on top. Bring to a simmer, then cover the whole dish with a tight-fitting lid (or foil). Turn the heat to medium and cook for 6 minutes. Uncover and stir to incorporate the dry top layer of pasta. Push the mussels into the pasta so the hinges are buried in the bottom of the dish, and they stand straight up. Arrange the prawns on top, cover tightly and cook for another 6 minutes or until the mussels are open, the prawns are pink and the pasta is cooked through. Leave to simmer for another 2-3 minutes to cook off most of the remaining liquid (leave a little in the pan to prevent the pasta from sticking together). Allow to sit for 2-3 minutes, then squeeze over the lemon juice and arrange the wedges on top. Scatter with parsley before serving.",

When the potato are soft and the onion is shiny, crush 2 garlic and stir in, followed by the beaten egg. Put the lid back on the pan and leave the tortilla to cook gently. After 20 minutes, the edges and base should be golden, the top set but the middle still a little wobbly. To turn it over, slide it onto a plate and put another plate on top, turn the whole thing over and slide it back into the pan to finish cooking. Once cooked, transfer to a plate and serve the tortilla warm or cold, scattered with the parsley. To accompany, take slices of warmed baguette, stab all over with a fork and rub with the remaining garlic, pile on grated tomato and season with sea salt and a drizzle of olive oil.",

The fruit will be softened, mostly intact and surrounded by dark red juice. Put a sieve over a bowl and tip in the fruit and juice. Line the bowl with cling film and prepare the bread: Line the basin with cling film as this will help you to turn out the pudding. Overlap 2 pieces of cling film in the middle of the bowl as it's easier than trying to get one sheet to stick to all of the curves. Let the edges overhang by about 15cm. Cut the crusts off the bread. Cut 4 pieces of bread in half, a little on an angle, to give 2 lopsided rectangles per piece. Cut 2 slices into 4 triangles each and leave the final piece whole. Build the pud: Dip the whole piece of bread into the juice for a few secs just to coat. Push this into the bottom of the basin. Now dip the wonky rectangular pieces one at a time and press around the basin's sides so that they fit together neatly, alternately placing wide and narrow ends up. If you can't quite fit the last piece of bread in it doesn't matter, just trim into a triangle, dip in juice and slot in. Now spoon in the softened fruit, adding the strawberries here and there as you go. Let flavours mingle then serve: Dip the bread triangles in juice and place on top \u2013 trim off overhang with scissors. Keep leftover juice for later. Bring cling film up and loosely seal. Put a side plate on top and weight down with cans. Chill for 6 hours or overnight. To serve, open out cling film then put a serving plate upside-down on top and flip over. serve with leftover juice, any extra berries and cream.",

For the dumplings, mix the flour and suet with a pinch of salt and 9 fl oz of water to make a dough. Wrap the mixture in clingfilm and leave in the fridge to rest. Open the can of ackee, drain and rinse, then set aside. Heat a tbsp of olive oil in a pan and fry the onion until softened but not brown. Add the spices, seasoning, pepper sauce and sliced peppers and continue to fry until the peppers are tender. Add the tomato, then the salt cod and mix together. Lastly stir in the ackee very gently and leave to simmer until ready to serve. When you're almost ready to eat, heat a little vegetable oil in a frying pan and heat until it starts smoking. Shape the dumpling mix into plum-size balls and shallow-fry until golden-brown. Drain the dumplings on kitchen paper and serve with the saltfish and ackee.",

        "strInstructions": " Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.  Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.  Beat the 3 large egg in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated pepper. Set everything aside.  Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).  Squash 2 peeled plump garlic with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.  While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.  Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.  Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don't worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don't throw the pasta water away yet.  Mix most of the cheese in with the egg, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later. 0 Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the egg and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn't scramble, and everything is coated. 1 Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tbsp should do it). You don't want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed. 2 Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.",

        "strDrinkAlternate": null,
        "strCategory": "Dessert",
        "strArea": "British",
        "strInstructions": "Pie Crust: In a food processor, place the flour, salt, and sugar and process until combined. Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles coarse meal (about 15 seconds). Pour \u00bc cup (60 ml) water in a slow, steady stream, through the feed tube until the dough just holds together when pinched. If necessary, add more water. Do not process more than 30 seconds. Turn the dough onto your work surface and gather into a ball. Divide the dough in half, flattening each half into a disk, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about one hour before using. This will chill the butter and relax the gluten in the flour.  After the dough has chilled sufficiently, remove one portion of the dough from the fridge and place it on a lightly floured surface. Roll the pastry into a 12 inch (30 cm) circle. (To prevent the pastry from sticking to the counter and to ensure uniform thickness, keep lifting up and turning the pastry a quarter turn as you roll (always roll from the center of the pastry outwards).) Fold the dough in half and gently transfer to a 9 inch (23 cm) pie pan. Brush off any excess flour and trim any overhanging pastry to an edge of \u00bd inch (1\u00bd cm). Refrigerate the pastry, covered with plastic wrap, while you make the filling.  Remove the second round of pastry and roll it into a 13 inch (30 cm) circle. Using a pastry wheel or pizza cutter, cut the pastry into about 00be inch (2 cm) strips. Place the strips of pastry on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes.  Make the Strawberry Rhubarb Filling: Place the cut strawberries and rhubarb in a large bowl. In a small bowl mix together the cornstarch, sugar, and ground cinnamon.  Remove the chilled pie crust from the fridge. Sprinkle about 2 tbsp of the sugar mixture over the bottom of the pastry crust. Add the remaining sugar mixture to the strawberries and rhubarb and gently toss to combine. Pour the fruit mixture into the prepared pie shell. Sprinkle the fruit with about 1 tsp of lemon juice and dot with 2 tbsp of butter. Remove the lattice pastry from the refrigerator and, starting at the center with the longest strips and working outwards, place half the strips, spacing about 1 inch (2\u00bd cm) apart, on top of the filling. (Use the shortest pastry strips at the outer edges.) Then, gently fold back, about halfway, every other strip of pastry. Take another strip of pastry and place it perpendicular on top of the first strips of pastry. Unfold the bottom strips of pastry and then fold back the strips that weren't folded back the first time. Lay another strip of pastry perpendicular on top of the filling and then continue with the remaining strips. Trim the edges of the pastry strips, leaving a 1 inch (2\u00bd cm) overhang. Seal the edges of the pastry strips by folding them under the bottom pastry crust and flute the edges of the pastry. Brush the lattice pastry with milk and sprinkle with a little sugar. Cover and place in the refrigerator while you preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) and place the oven rack in the lower third of the oven. Put a baking sheet, lined with aluminum foil, on the oven rack (to catch any spills.) Place the pie plate on the hot baking sheet and bake the pie for about 35 minutes and then, if the edges of the pie are browning too much, cover with a foil ring. Continue to bake the pie for about another 10 minutes or until the crust is a golden brown color and the fruit juices begin to bubble. Remove the pie from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for several hours. Serve at room temperature with softly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for about 3 days. Reheat before serving. This pie can be frozen. Makes one 9 inch (23 cm) pie.",

Lift the edge of the mat over the rice, applying a little pressure to keep everything in a tight roll. Stick down the sides like a stamp. When you get to the edge without any rice, brush with a little water and continue to roll into a tight roll. Wrap in cling film. Remove the mat and roll tightly in cling film before cutting the sushi into thick slices, then unravel the cling film. Layer over some smoked salmon. Line a loaf tin with cling film, then place a thin layer of smoked salmon inside on top of the cling film. Cover with rice and press down. Press about 1\u00bd in of rice over the fish, fold the cling film over and press down as much as you can, using another tin if you have one. Tip it out like a sandcastle. Turn block of sushi onto a chopping board. Cut into smaller pieces, then remove the cling film. Choose your topping. Get a small square of cling film and place a topping on it. Use damp hands to roll walnut-sized balls of rice and place on the topping. Make into tight balls. Bring the corners of the cling film together and tighten into balls by twisting it up, then unwrap and serve.",

Tip in the potato and beans and let them warm through in the hot coconut milk, then add a lovely citrussy flavour by stirring in the shredded lime leaves (or lime zest).

        "strInstructions": "First make the short crust pastry: measure the flour into a large bowl and rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs (alternatively, this can be done in a food processor). Add about three tbsp of cold water and mix to a firm dough, wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) and put a heavy baking tray in the oven to heat up. Grease a deep 18cm/7in loose-bottomed fluted flan tin with butter. Remove about 150g/5\u00bdoz of pastry from the main ball and set aside for the lattice top. Roll the rest of the pastry out thinly on a lightly floured work surface and line the prepared flan tin with the pastry. Prick the base with a fork, to stop the base rising up during baking. Place the reserved pastry for the lattice top on cling film and roll out thinly. Egg wash the pastry and set aside to chill in the fridge (the cling film makes it easier to move about). Do not cut into strips at this stage. Do not egg wash the strips once they are on the tart as it will drip into the treacle mixture. To make the filling, heat the syrup gently in a large pan but do not boil. Once melted, add the breadcrumbs, lemon juice and zest to the syrup. (You can add less lemon if you would prefer less citrus taste.) If the mixture looks runny, add a few more breadcrumbs. Pour the syrup mixture into the lined tin and level the surface. Remove the reserved pastry from the fridge and cut into long strips, 1cm/\u00bdin wide. Make sure they are all longer than the edges of the tart tin. Egg wash the edge of the pastry in the tin, and start to make the woven laying lattice pattern over the mixture, leave the strips hanging over the edge of the tin. Once the lattice is in place, use the tin edge to cut off the strips by pressing down with your hands, creating a neat finish. Bake on the pre-heated baking tray in the hot oven for about 10 minutes until the pastry has started to color, and then reduce the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). If at this stage the lattice seems to be getting too dark brown, cover the tart with tin foil. Bake for a further 25-30 minutes until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling set. Remove the tart from the oven and leave to firm up in the tin. Serve warm or cold.",

Lightly prick all over with a fork, wrap in cling film on a baking sheet and freeze while preparing the apples. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Peel, quarter and core the apples. Put the sugar in a flameproof 20cm ceramic Tatin dish or a 20cm ovenproof heavy-based frying pan and place over a medium-high heat. Cook the sugar for 5-7 minutes to a dark amber caramel syrup that's starting to smoke, then turn off the heat and stir in the 60g diced butter. To assemble the Tarte Tatin, arrange the apple quarters very tightly in a circle around the edge of the dish first, rounded-side down, then fill in the middle in a similar fashion. Gently press with your hands to ensure there are no gaps. Brush the fruit with the melted butter. Bake in the oven for 30 minutes, then remove and place the disc of frozen puff pastry on top \u2013 it will quickly defrost. Tuck the edges down the inside of the dish and, with a knife, prick a few holes in the pastry to allow steam to escape. Bake for a further 40-45 minutes until the pastry is golden brown and crisp. Allow to cool to room temperature for 1 hour before running a knife around the edge of the dish and inverting it onto a large serving plate that is deep enough to contain the juices. Serve with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or vanilla ice cream.",

        "strInstructions": "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6 and butter 4 small (about 200ml) ramekins. Sprinkle the Parmesan into the ramekins, turning until all sides are covered. Place the milk and bay leaves in a large saucepan over a gentle heat and bring to the boil. Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 15 minutes. Discard the bay leaves, add the butter and flour, and return to a low heat. Very gently simmer, stirring continuously with a balloon whisk, for about 6 minutes until you get a smooth, thick white sauce. Make sure that you get right into the corners of the pan to stop the sauce from catching or becoming lumpy. Once thickened, transfer the sauce to a large bowl and stir in the mustard powder, cayenne pepper, Gruy\u00e8re and egg yolks until fully combined. In a spotlessly clean bowl and with a clean whisk, beat the egg whites just until peaks begin to form. Carefully fold the egg whites into the cheese sauce in three stages making sure you fold, rather than stir, to keep the egg whites light and airy. Fill the prepared ramekins with the soufflée mix. Top each soufflée with a slice of goat's cheese, then place on a baking tray. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until springy and well risen but cooked through. Leave to cool, then run a knife around the edge of each dish and remove the soufflées. If preparing in advance, place soufflées upside down (for neat presentation), on a tray. Cover tray in cling film. Chill for a few days or freeze for up to 1 month. When ready to re-bake, heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Place the upside-down soufflées in a shallow baking dish, top with the remaining goat's cheese slices and pour over the cream (this stops them from drying out when baked for the second time). Cook for 8-10 minutes until golden. Serve immediately alongside some simply dressed salad.",

Add the tuna, egg, hot pepper sauce, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Take one filo round and very lightly brush with some of the remaining oil. Top with a second round and brush with a little oil, then place a third round on top and brush with oil. Place a heaped tbsp of the filling in the middle of the round, then fold the pastry over to make a half-moon shape. Fold in the edges, twisting them to seal, and place on a non-stick baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pastry and filling to make 8 briks in all. Lightly brush the briks with the remaining oil. Bake for 12\u201315 minutes or until the pastry is crisp and golden brown. Meanwhile, combine the tomato and cucumber in a bowl and sprinkle with the lemon juice and seasoning to taste. Serve the briks hot with this salad and the chutney.",

Heat the oil to 180C \u2013 if you don't have a thermometer, drop a bit of panko into the oil and if it sinks a little then starts to fry, the oil is ready. Add 2 pork chops and cook for 1 min 30 secs on each side, then remove and leave to rest on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Repeat with the remaining pork chops.  While the pork is resting, make the sauce by whisking the ingredients together, adding a splash of water if it's particularly thick. Slice the tonkatsu and serve drizzled with the sauce.",
